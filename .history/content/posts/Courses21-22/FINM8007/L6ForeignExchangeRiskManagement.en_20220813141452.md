## Foreign Exchange Exposure

**Foreign exchange exposure** is a measure of the potential for a firm’s profitability, net cash flow and market value to change because of **unexpected changes in exchange rates**.

Categories of Foreign Exchange Exposure

- Transaction Exposure
- Operating/ Economic exposure

### Transaction Exposure

The potential for a **change in the value of outstanding foreign exchange payments and receipts** due to exchange rate changes prior to settlement. Transactions can be of either a current or capital nature.

Examples:

- Import of goods on credit with prices quoted in foreign currency.
- Receipt of dividends from off-shore subsidiaries

### Operating/Economic exposure

Measures the change in the present value of the firm resulting from **changes in future operating cash flows** caused by unexpected exchange rate movements.

- It assesses the impact of exchange rate changes both on the firm’s operations and on the firm’s **competitive position**
- Can impact on firms that have no foreign currency positions
