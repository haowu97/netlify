Learning Objectives
- To analyze and discuss the **currency regime choices** faced by countries
- To compare **fixed and flexible** exchange rate systems
- To examine **undervalued and overvalued** exchange rates and their consequences
- To explain different **measures and uses** of exchange rates

<!--more-->

# 1. Exchange Rate Regimes

**Flexible exchange rate system** – the demand and supply of market participants determine the currency value.

**Fixed exchange rate system** – monetary authorities operate an administered system to determine the currency value

## 1.1 Fixed exchange rate system

**Currency Board**
- Sets the exchange rate at a fixed rate which is then kept stable by the board using **official reserves of foreign currencies**
- Domestic money supply must be backed 100% by foreign reserves.
- **Examples**: Argentina 1991 – 2002: A/peso tied to the US＄ at rate of Peso1 = US＄1

**Narrow band**
- Currency tied to an anchor (such as the US$) with **a small margin** of variation around the parity value permitted
- Includes ‘crawling peg’ arrangements
- Examples: Bretton Woods System 1945-1971, Currencies tied to the US dollar or UK pound sterling.

## 1.2 Flexible exchange rate system


**Managed Float**
- Monetary authorities **actively intervene** to influence the exchange rate without announcing a particular value for the currency
- e.g. China, Indonesia, India, Thailand

**Independent Floating**
- The exchange rate is **determined by the market** with minimal interference by monetary authorities. Any intervention aims to prevent undue volatility.
- e.g. Australia, New Zealand, UK, USA


## 1.3 Fixed Versus Flexible?

Disadvantages of fixed exchange rate systems:
- Fixed rates require large holdings of **official reserve assets**;
- Fixed rates **limit the role of monetary policy** in achieving internal balance;
- Fixed rates may be maintained at levels **inconsistent with economic fundamentals**.

Advantages of fixed exchange rate systems:
- Fixed rates provide greater **stability for international prices**;
- Stable exchange rates **aid growth** in international trade and investment and
**lessen risks** for international business.


Practice (PRACTICE QUESTIONS SET 1): What are the key advantages and disadvantages of the fixed exchange rate system?

# 3. Calculating exchange rate changes

Direct Quotes:

$$
\% \Delta=\frac{R_{2}-R_{1}}{R_{1}} \times 100
$$

Where $ R_{2}= $ end rate and $ R_{1}= $ beginning rate.

Indirect Quotes:
$$
\% \Delta=\frac{R_{1}-R_{2}}{R_{2}} \times 100
$$

# 4. Impact of currency depreciation

Impact on imports and exports:
- Export prices fall in foreign currency terms
- Import prices rise in domestic currency terms
- Over time lower export prices increase demand for exports and higher import prices reduce demand for imports
- International competitiveness improves

Impact on loans and investments:
- For borrowers:
  - Existing foreign debt is more expensive to repay for Australian borrowers
  - If raising new debt, choose currencies expected to depreciate against the A$ since overseas debt is cheaper to repay
- For investors:
  - Existing foreign assets have gone up in value
  - If choosing new assets, select currencies expected to appreciate against the A$ since overseas assets increase in value

Impact on production decisions:
- The Aussie dollar depreciation makes it relatively cheaper to produce in Australia and to use Australian inputs
