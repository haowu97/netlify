# Factors Which Influence Exchange Rates

## 1.1 Relative Inflation Rates - Purchasing Power Parity

Purchasing power parity (PPP) is based on the relationship between exchange rates and relative prices.

### 1.1.1 Law of One Price

The **Law of One Price** states that the prices of traded goods and services - when expressed in a common currency - are the same in all countries. For instance,

$$
P^{\$} \times S^{￥ / \$}=P^{￥}
$$

Where the price of the product in $ A $ \$'s $ \left(P^{\$}\right) $, multiplied by the spot exchange rate (S, yen per dollar), equals the price of the product in Japanese yen $ \left(P^{￥}\right) $.

**Practice** (PRACTICE QUESTIONS SET TWO): What is the ‘law of one price’? According to this ‘law’, what should happen to the currency of a country experiencing hyper-inflation?

**Answer**: 

- The ‘law of one price’ states that producers’ prices for goods or services of identical quality should be the same in different markets (i.e. different countries) assuming **no restrictions on sales and allowing for transportation costs**. If a country has **higher inflation** than other countries, its **currency should devalue/depreciate** so that the real price remains the same in all countries. 
- Application of this law results in the theory of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). A country experiencing hyper-inflation needs substantial depreciation of its nominal exchange rate to restore PPP.

### 1.1.2 Purchasing power parity

PPP predicts an **inverse relationship between the domestic exchange rate and its inflation rate** relative to trading partners: the domestic currency will depreciate as domestic inflation rises relative to trading partners


**Absolute PPP** expresses the exchange rate as the ratio of the price levels in the two countries:
$$
S^{￥ / \$}=\frac{P^{￥}}{P^{\$}}
$$

**Relative PPP** states that **the differential in inflation rates** between two countries will determine the change in the exchange rate over the given period

$$
S_{2}^{￥ / \$}=S_{1}^{￥ / \$} \times \frac{\left(1+\pi_{\text {Jap }}\right)}{\left(1+\pi_{\text {USA }}\right)}
$$
