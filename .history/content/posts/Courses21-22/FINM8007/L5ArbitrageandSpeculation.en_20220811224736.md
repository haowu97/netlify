## 1. Arbitrage and Speculation

Speculators and arbitrageurs **seek to profit** from trading in the market.

- They operate for their **own interest, without need or obligation** to serve clients or ensure a continuous market.
- A large proportion of speculation and arbitrage is conducted **on behalf of major banks** by dealers employed by those banks.

Arbitrage Transactions

- An arbitrageur takes advantage of opportunities for profit which arise from short-term price discrepancies between different markets
- There is no risk - buy and sell at the same time
- Arbitrage actions eliminate the price differentials

Speculative Transactions

- Speculators aim to make a profit by buying at a low price and selling at a higher price
- Entails risk since expectations may not be fulfilled
- ‘Short’ - sell before buying if expect asset price to fall
- ‘Long’ - buy prior to selling if expect asset price to rise

## 2. Foreign Currency Arbitrage

### 2.1 Covered Interest Arbitrage

Capital flow:
$$
i^{DC} = i^{\text{FC}} + \text{Forward Magin}
$$

To calculate the forward rate

$$
F_{n}^{\text{FX/\$}}=S^{\text{FX/\$}} \times \frac{\left[1+\left(i^{\text{FX}} \times \frac{n}{360}\right)\right]}{\left[1+\left(i^{\$} \times \frac{n}{360}\right)\right]}
$$

**Practice** (Semester 1 -- Review Question, 2021) Question 3: Suppose that you are a trader in Japan and you see the following quotes on your screen:

| Spot exchange rate       | 86.85 Japanese Yen (JPY) per Australian dollar (AUD) |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 30-day forward rate      | 87.41 JPY per AUD                                    |
| 30-day AUD interest rate | 4% per annum (p.a.)                                  |
| 30-day JPY Interest rate | 1% p.a.                                              |

Assuming that you have JPY 1 million, can you make a profit (in JPY) with these quotes? Show your working clearly.

**Solution**:
