Learning Objectives

- To explain the derivation of forward exchange rates and the size of **forward premiums and discounts**
- To examine the connection between international **money markets** and the foreign exchange market
- To discuss the concept of **interest rate parity** and its influence in the foreign exchange market

# 1. Forward Exchange Quotes

A **forward rate**is an exchange rate quoted today for settlement at some future date.

- The forward exchange agreement states the rate of exchange at which a foreign currency will be bought or sold forward at *a specific date in the future (typically 30, 60, 90, 180, 270 or 360 days)*

The forward rate is calculated by adjusting the current spot rate by a **forward margin** (in points)

$$
\text{forward rate} = \text{spot rate} \pm \text{forward points}
$$

Example:

| Spot rate USD/AUD            | 0.6695 – 0.6700  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 3 month forward points       | -0.0040 – 0.0038 |
| 3 month forward rate USD/AUD | 0.6655 – 0.6662  |

1. bank buys AUD/sells USD three months forward at USD 0.6655 per AUD1, and
2. bank sells AUD/buys USD three months forward at USD 0.6662 per AUD1


# Forward Margin

Forward margin is either a **discount or a premium** over the spot rate.

The **forward margin** (FM) can be quoted in points or in annual percentage terms. To convert **points** to **annual percentages** use the following formulas:

- For indirect quotes:

$$ 
\text{FM}=\left[\frac{\text { Spot }}{\text { Forward }}-1 \right] \times \frac{360}{\text { days }} \times 100 
$$

- For direct quotes:

$$ 
\text{FM}=\left[\frac{\text { Forward }}{\text { Spot }}-1 \right] \times \frac{360}{\text { days }} \times 100 
$$

Example:

| Spot rate USD/AUD            | 0.6695 – 0.6700  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 3 month forward points       | -0.0040 – 0.0038 |
| 3 month forward rate USD/AUD | 0.6655 – 0.6662  |

The **forward margin on the US\$ (bank sell US\$)** in per cent per annum terms would be:

$$
\text{FM}= \frac{0.6695-0.6655}{0.6655} \times \frac{360}{90} \times 100 = +2.4 \% 
$$

The positive sign indicates that the bank sells the US\$ forward at a premium of 2.4\% p.a. 
- it takes 2.4\% more A\$’s to get a US$ at the 90-day forward rate.


Size of the forward margin is determined by the **interest rate differential** between the two countries.

Banks set the forward margin to equalize the **covered borrowing costs** and **investment returns** across countries
- If not an arbitrage opportunity exists

The forward margin reflects the interest rate differential
