# 1. Exchange Rate Regimes

**Flexible exchange rate system** – the demand and supply of market participants determine the currency value.

**Fixed exchange rate system** – monetary authorities operate an administered system to determine the currency value

**Currency Board**
- Sets the exchange rate at a fixed rate which is then kept stable by the board using **official reserves of foreign currencies**
- Domestic money supply must be backed 100% by foreign reserves.
- **Examples**: Argentina 1991 – 2002: A/peso tied to the US＄ at rate of Peso1 = US＄1

**Narrow band**
- Currency tied to an anchor (such as the US$) with **a small margin** of variation around the parity value permitted
- Includes ‘crawling peg’ arrangements
• Examples:
 Bretton Woods System 1945-1971
- Currencies tied to the US dollar or UK pound sterling
 Hungarian Forint
- Tied to the Euro
 Chinese Renminbi (yuan)
- Tied to a basket of currencies
