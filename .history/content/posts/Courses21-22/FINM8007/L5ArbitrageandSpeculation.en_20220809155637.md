# 1. Speculators and Arbitragers

Speculators and arbitrageurs **seek to profit** from trading in the market.

- They operate for their **own interest, without need or obligation** to serve clients or ensure a continuous market.
- A large proportion of speculation and arbitrage is conducted **on behalf of major banks** by dealers employed by those banks.

Arbitrage Transactions

- An arbitrageur takes advantage of opportunities for profit which arise from short-term price discrepancies between different markets
- There is no risk - buy and sell at the same time
- Arbitrage actions eliminate the price differentials

Speculative Transactions

- Speculators aim to make a profit by buying at a low price and selling at a higher price
- Entails risk since expectations may not be fulfilled
- ‘Short’ - sell before buying if expect asset price to fall
- ‘Long’ - buy prior to selling if expect asset price to rise
