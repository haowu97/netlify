- To explain different **measures and uses** of exchange rates

# 1. Exchange Rate Regimes

**Flexible exchange rate system** – the demand and supply of market participants determine the currency value.

**Fixed exchange rate system** – monetary authorities operate an administered system to determine the currency value

## 2.1 Fixed exchange rate system

**Currency Board**
- Sets the exchange rate at a fixed rate which is then kept stable by the board using **official reserves of foreign currencies**
- Domestic money supply must be backed 100% by foreign reserves.
- **Examples**: Argentina 1991 – 2002: A/peso tied to the US＄ at rate of Peso1 = US＄1

**Narrow band**
- Currency tied to an anchor (such as the US$) with **a small margin** of variation around the parity value permitted
- Includes ‘crawling peg’ arrangements
- Examples: Bretton Woods System 1945-1971, Currencies tied to the US dollar or UK pound sterling.

## 2.2 Flexible exchange rate system


**Managed Float**
- Monetary authorities **actively intervene** to influence the exchange rate without announcing a particular value for the currency
- e.g. China, Indonesia, India, Thailand

**Independent Floating**
- The exchange rate is **determined by the market** with minimal interference by monetary authorities. Any intervention aims to prevent undue volatility.
- e.g. Australia, New Zealand, UK, USA


Calculating exchange rate changes

Direct Quotes:

$$
\% \Delta=\frac{R_{2}-R_{1}}{R_{1}} \times 100
$$

Where $ R_{2}= $ end rate and $ R_{1}= $ beginning rate.

Indirect Quotes:
$$
\% \Delta=\frac{R_{1}-R_{2}}{R_{2}} \times 100
