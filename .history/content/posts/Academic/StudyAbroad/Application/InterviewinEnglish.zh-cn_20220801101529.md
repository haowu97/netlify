# 自我介绍

My name is Wu Hao, and I'm really happy/ glad to be here today. (自信的开始)

// I will talk about my academic background, and my research. (自我介绍的内容)

I've almost completed my Master's degree in Finance at Xiamen University, and I believe that I am competent for this position.

First and foremost, I am a motivated, enthusiastic, and loyal person who is interested in quantitative finance and fintech. In 2018, I signed up for the UBS Global Quantitative Competition and won the runner-up. In this competition, I built a multi-factor stock selection model with the SVM machine learning algorithm. I also used to work as a research assistant in Huatai Securities, during which I built CTA strategies and performed strategy backtesting and optimization.

In addition, I have the econometric and programming skills you need, especially with Python and Stata. In my major bachelor thesis, I used Stata to process large survey data and used PSM-DID method to do causality inference. In my minor bachelor thesis, I conducted textual sentiment analysis on Sina Weibo text data with Python. In my master thesis,  I also employed Python to obtain and process Chinese A-share listed company data, and then I performed event study and panel regression with Stata.

Finally, If I have the chance, I will prove myself to be a valuable asset to your team.

Thank you for your time.

讲得流畅，自信很重要！
