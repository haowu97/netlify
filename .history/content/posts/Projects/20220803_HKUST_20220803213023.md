I wonder if you could do another coding test. Do you mind reading through the attached paper and use the dataset on kaggle below to replicate the mispricing signal?  In particular, it would be good if you can replicate the table 2 in the paper.

Note that the paper uses the US data and the kaggle datasets cover the Chinese stocks. So you donâ€™t have to (cannot) use exactly the same variables as the paper. You can make your judgement to choose the relevant fundamental variables. You would only need the **fund.parquet.gzip and msf.parquet.gzip datasets**, which contains the monthly fundamental and stock price/return information. You may find the variables definitions from the **Data Menu.xlsx** file. I also attached some sample code how to use the datasets:
