I wonder if you could do another coding test. Do you mind reading through the attached paper and use the dataset on kaggle below to replicate the mispricing signal?  In particular, it would be good if you can replicate the table 2 in the paper.

Note that the paper uses the US data and the kaggle datasets cover the Chinese stocks. So you don’t have to (cannot) use exactly the same variables as the paper. You can make your judgement to choose the relevant fundamental variables. You would only need the **fund.parquet.gzip and msf.parquet.gzip datasets**, which contains the monthly fundamental and stock price/return information. You may find the variables definitions from the **Data Menu.xlsx** file. I also attached some sample code how to use the datasets:

# 指标计算

As is customary when analyzing accounting data, all variables are **winzorized** based on their ratio to total assets at the top and bottom 5%, using the sample distribution that exists for that variable from all sample data released prior to and including month t.


The 16 balance sheet items are from the most recently released accounting statement (10-K or 10-Q).

**Those from the income and cash flow statements are sums of the quarterly values from the three most recently released 10-Qs and 10-K.**


TS 估计量具体构建方式如下：每月随机抽取100 家公司，利用该子样本的28 个会计指标和市值数据测算所有公司的同行隐含公允价值，重复上述操作100000 次；对于某家公司来说，该公司当月的同行隐含公允价值便是100000个模型拟合值的中位数。
