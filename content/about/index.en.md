### My Favorite English Song：

{{< music "https://music.163.com/#/song?id=5264843" >}}

### 这是始终给予我勇气的一句话:

Those times when you get up early and you work hard; those times when you stay up late and you work hard; those times when don’t feel like working — you’re too tired, you don’t want to push yourself — but you do it anyway. That is **actually the dream**. That’s the dream. It’s not the destination, it’s the journey. And if you guys can understand that, what you’ll see happen is that you won’t accomplish your dreams, your dreams won’t come true, something greater will.  ——Kobe
