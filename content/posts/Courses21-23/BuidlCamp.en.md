Courses overview
In this five-week BuidlCamp training, lecturers from the blockchain industry will cover the hot topics in the Web3.0 World:

Lesson 1 — Step into Web3.0 and Blockchain

What is Bitcoin, consensus mechanism, decentralization? Why do we need blockchain technology? Understanding the history and development of the blockchain world is essential to enter the Web3.0 World.

Lesson 2 — From CeFi to DeFi

Decentralizing transactions is the reason for the emergence of the blockchain and the ultimate goal of DeFi.

Lesson 3 — Ethereum and the “ETH Killers”

As the most well-established chain in the ecosystem, Ethereum has powerful technical and mechanical advantages, but the “Dark Horses” in the blockchain world also have their own trump card.

Lesson 4 — NFT and Metaverse, Paradise or Scam？

As decentralized products, NFT and Metaverse are endowed with more social attributes and cultural values. Whether it is an innovative economic model or a “Stupid tax”, every Web3.0 user should have their own thinking.

Lesson 5 — Build Web3.0 Together!

How to participate in the building of Web3.0 World? Becoming the Project party is not the only way. Every user in the Web3.0 World is promoting technological innovation in their own way.

## Digital economy

Digital economy is growing rapidly. The digital economy can be broadly divided into two categories:

- Category 1: **Industry Digitization**. This includes a very wide range of industries, such as Industry 4.0, the loT, artificial intelligence, intelligent manufacturing and so on. It is usually closely related to the "real economy".
- Category 2: **Digital Industrialization**. Pure digital economy, including the virtual digital economy, meta-universe, etc.The blockchain and Web3.0 driven economy is growing by leaps and bounds.

And the boundary between the two is very blurry.

2.Current contribution of the digital economy to global
GDP:

- **The digital economy accounts for nearly 40% of global GDP**.
- The second category, digital industrialization, accounts for 5-7% of GDP, but it is growing at one of the fastest rates of any economic sector.

## Web2.0 - Monopoly

In year 2020, the revenue sum of top 10 tech companies is 1.8 trillion, which equals to the GDP of Italy.

From 2005 to 2020, the revenue of google increased over 2000%, and the revenue of amazon increased over 4000%.

## The Road to Web3.0

1. Web 1.0: Read-only Static
2. Web 2.0: Read-Write Interactive
3. Web 3.0: Read-Write-Own Ownership

More importantly, Web 3.0 proposed by Gavin Woods (2014)represents a conceptual change, with its core being:

1. Re-Recognition of Value
2. Fair Sharing of Value

### Web 3.0 Economy: Ownership & Re-Recognition of Value

- Web 2.0 owns every content, which is extremely unfair
- Web 3.0 gives the ownership back to users
- Web 3.0 often emphasizes distribution and decentralization.

Personally, I don't think that's the essence. The Web 3.0 concept can be fully implemented in a centralized or semi-centralized form.

**Realization** is another important part of web 3.0. Nowadays, GameFi, X2Earn(X2E) are hits, which are all embodiment of **value re-recognition**.

The metaverse is closely connected with Web 3.0.

### Web3.0 Economy: Fairness & re-distribution

## The Challenge of Web3.0

- Decentralized system has limitations on TPS and storage capacity.
  - Bitcoin 7 TPS
  - Solana 4000 TPS,but often occur problems
- The sustainability of GameFi and X2Earn (X2E)'s business model is doubtable.
- In the future, Web 3.0 needs to combine more with real economy.
- Jack Dorsey has initiated Web 5.0 = Web 3.0 + Web 2.0.

## What is Metaverse?

My definition: Metaverse is the ultimate ecosystem for the future digital economy.

The concept of a metaverse depicts a digital world that is both parallel and merging with the real world, where our
imaginations are boundless. Yet the metaverse most of us think of right now, including immersive AR/VR/MR experiences,digital twins, Play2Earn games, and more, are a tiny fraction of the metaverse.

We are not even in Metaverse 1.0 yet.

## Digital Economy and Globalization

We have seen in recent years a retreat from globalization, which is often blamed as a cause of growing inequality,rightly or wrongly.

The development of the world mirrors the development of Web2 monopolies.

Web3.0 digital economy represents a true globalized economy that is beyond geo-political conflicts, and more importantly, an engine for more equitable growth around the world.

Let us hope we can all live happily and peacefully in the Metaverse.

### How Does Ethereum Work

"A 'smart contract'is simply a program thatruns on the Ethereum blockchain.It's a
collection of code (its functions)and data (itsstate)that resides at a specific address on the
Ethereum blockchain."
