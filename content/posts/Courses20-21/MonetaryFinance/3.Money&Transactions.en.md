## 3.1 Introduction

In this chapter, we will learn about:

1. Shopping-Time Models
2. CIA Models

In keeping with the approach used in examining money-in-the-utility (MIU) models, the focus in this chapter is on general equilibrium models in which the demand for money arises from its use in carrying out transactions.

## 3.2 Resource Costs of Transacting

A direct approach to modeling the role of money in facilitating transactions is to **assume that the purchase of goods requires the input of transaction services**. 

1. First a model is considered in which theses services are produced using inputs of money and time. 
2. Then an alternative approach is studied in which there are real resource costs in terms of goods that are incurred in purchasing consumption goods. 

Larger holdings of money allow the household to reduce the resource costs of producing transaction services.

### 3.2.1 Shopping-Time Models

Higher levels of money holdings reduce the time needed for shopping, thereby increasing the individual agentâ€™s leisure. When leisure enters the utility function of the representative agent, shopping-time models provide a link between the MIU approach and models of money that focus more explicitly on transaction services and money as a medium of exchange.

Suppose that purchasing consumption requires transaction services $ \psi, $ with units chosen so that consumption of $ c $ requires transaction services $ \psi=c . $ These transaction services are produced with inputs of real cash balances $ m \equiv M / P $ and shopping time $ n^{s} $ :
$$
 \psi=\psi\left(m, n^{s}\right)=c  \tag{3.1}
$$
where $ \psi_{m} \geq 0, \psi_{n^{s}} \geq 0 $ and $ \psi_{m m} \leq 0, \psi_{n^{s} n^{s}} \leq 0 $. 

Rewriting (3.1) in terms of the shopping time required for given levels of consumption and money holdings,
$$
n^{s}=g(c, m), \quad g_{c}>0, g_{m} \leq 0
$$
Household utility is assumed to depend on consumption and leisure: $ v(c, l) . $ Leisure is equal to $ l=1-n-n^{s} $, where $ n $ is time spent in market employment and $ n^{s} $ is time spent shopping. Total time available is normalized to equal $ 1 . $ 

Now define a function
$$
u(c, m, n) \equiv v[c, 1-n-g(c, m)] 
$$
that gives utility as a function of consumption, labor supply, and money holdings. Thus, a simple shopping-time model can motivate the appearance of an MIU function and, more important, can help determine the properties of the partial derivatives of the function $ u $ with respect to $ m $. By placing restrictions on the partial derivatives of the shopping time production function $ g(c, m), $ one potentially can determine what restrictions might be placed on the utility function $ u(c, m, n) . $ 

In the MIU model, higher expected inflation lowered money holdings, but the effect on leisure and consumption depended on the signs of $ u_{l m} $ and $ u_{c m} $. The shopping-time model implies that $ u_{m}=-v_{l} g_{m} \geq 0, $ so
$$
u_{c m}=\left(v_{l l} g_{c}-v_{c l}\right) g_{m}-v_{l} g_{c m} \tag{3.2}
$$
From (3.2), the assumption of diminishing marginal utility of leisure $ \left(v_{l l} \leq 0\right) $ and $ g_{m} \leq 0 $ implies that $ v_{l l} g_{c} g_{m} \geq 0 $. In the benchmark MIU model, $u_{cm}$ was taken to be positive. Check whether this assumption was reasonable:

1. $u_{c m} >0$: If greater consumption raises the marginal productivity of money in reducing shopping time $ \left(g_{c m} \leq 0\right) $, then $ -v_{l} g_{c m} \geq 0 $ as well. Wang and Yip (1992) characterized the situation in which these two dominate, so that $ u_{c m} \geq 0 $ as the **transaction services version of the MIU model.** In this case, the MIU model implies that **a rise in expected inflation would lower $ m $ and $ u_{c}, $ and this would lower consumption, labor supply, and output** (see section 2.3.2). The reduction in labor supply is reinforced by the fact that $ u_{l m}=-v_{l l} g_{m}<0 $, so that the reduction in $ m $ raises the marginal utility of leisure. 

2. $ u_{c m} <0$: If consumption and leisure are strong substitutes so that $ v_{c l} \leq 0, $ then $ u_{c m} $ could be negative, a situation Wang and Yip described as corresponding to **an asset substitution model**. With $ u_{c m}<0 $, a **monetary injection that raises expected inflation will increase consumption, labor supply, and output.**

The household's objective is to maximize
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \beta^{i} v\left[c_{t+i}, 1-n_{t+i}-g\left(c_{t+i}, m_{t+i}\right)\right], \quad 0<\beta<1
$$
subject to
$$
f\left(k_{t-1}, n_{t}\right)+\tau_{t}+(1-\delta) k_{t-1}+\frac{\left(1+i_{t-1}\right) b_{t-1}+m_{t-1}}{1+\pi_{t}}=c_{t}+k_{t}+b_{t}+m_{t} \tag{3.3}
$$
where $ f $ is a standard neoclassical production function, $ k $ is the capital stock, $ \delta $ is the depreciation rate, $ b $ and $ m $ are real bond and money holdings, and $ \tau $ is a real lump-sum transfer from the government. Defining $ a_{t}=\tau_{t}+\left[\left(1+i_{t-1}\right) b_{t-1}+m_{t-1}\right] / $ $ \left(1+\pi_{t}\right), $ the household's decision problem can be written in terms of the value function $ V\left(a_{t}, k_{t-1}\right) $:
$$
V\left(a_{t}, k_{t-1}\right)=\max_{c,m,b,l} \left\{v\left[c_{t}, 1-n_{t}-g\left(c_{t}, m_{t}\right)\right]+\beta V\left(a_{t+1}, k_{t}\right)\right\}
$$
where the maximization is **subject to the constraints** $ f\left(k_{t-1}, n_{t}\right)+(1-\delta) k_{t-1}+a_{t} $ $ =c_{t}+k_{t}+b_{t}+m_{t} $ and $ a_{t+1}=\tau_{t+1}+\left[\left(1+i_{t}\right) b_{t}+m_{t}\right] /\left(1+\pi_{t+1}\right) . $ Proceeding as in chapter 2 by using these two constraints to eliminate $ k_{t} $ and $ a_{t+1} $ from the expression for the value function, the necessary first-order conditions for consumption, real money holdings, real bond holdings, and labor supply are
$$
\begin{align}
&v_{c}-v_{l} g_{c}-\beta V_{k}\left(a_{t+1}, k_{t}\right)=0 \tag{3.4} \\
&-v_{l} g_{m}+\beta \frac{V_{a}\left(a_{t+1}, k_{t}\right)}{1+\pi_{t+1}}-\beta V_{k}\left(a_{t+1}, k_{t}\right)=0 \tag{3.5} \\
& -v_{l}+\beta V_{k}\left(a_{t+1}, k_{t}\right) f_{n}\left(k_{t-1}, n_{t}\right)=0 \tag{3.6} \\
& \beta\left(\frac{1+i_{t}}{1+\pi_{t+1}}\right) V_{a}\left(a_{t+1}, k_{t}\right)-\beta V_{k}\left(a_{t+1}, k_{t}\right)=0 \tag{3.7}
\end{align}
$$
and the envelope theorem yields
$$
\begin{align}
& V_{a}\left(a_{t}, k_{t-1}\right)=\beta V_{k}\left(a_{t+1}, k_{t}\right) \tag{3.8} \\
& V_{k}\left(a_{t}, k_{t-1}\right)=\beta V_{k}\left(a_{t+1}, k_{t}\right)\left[f_{k}\left(k_{t-1}, n_{t}\right)+1-\delta\right] \tag{3.9} 
\end{align}
$$
Letting $ w_{t} $ denote the **marginal product of labor** (i.e., $ w_{t}=f_{n}\left(k_{t-1}, n_{t}\right)$), (3.6) and (3.8) yield $ v_{l}=w_{t} V_{a}\left(a_{t}, k_{t-1}\right) $. This implies that (3.4) can be written as
$$
v_{c}\left(c_{t}, l_{t}\right)=V_{a}\left(a_{t}, k_{t-1}\right)\left[1+w_{t} g_{c}\left(c_{t}, m_{t}\right)\right] \tag{3.10}
$$
The marginal utility of consumption is set equal to the marginal utility of wealth, $ V_{a}\left(a_{t}, k_{t-1}\right), $ plus the cost, in utility units, of the marginal time needed to purchase consumption. Thus, the total cost of consumption includes the value of the shopping time involved. A marginal increase in consumption requires an additional $ g_{c} $ in shopping time. The value of this time in terms of goods is obtained by multiplying $ g_{c} $ by the real wage $ w, $ and its value in terms of utility is $ V_{a}(a, k) w g_{c} $.

With $ g_{m} \leq 0, v_{l} g_{m}=V_{a} w g_{m} $ is the value in utility terms of the shopping time savings that results from additional holdings of real money balances. Equations (3.5) and (3.8) imply that money will be held to the point where the marginal net benefit, equal to the value of shopping time savings plus the discounted value of money's wealth value in the next period, or $ -v_{l} g_{m}+\beta V_{a}\left(a_{t+1}, k_{t}\right) /\left(1+\pi_{t+1}\right), $ just equals the net marginal utility of wealth. 

The first-order condition for optimal money holdings(3.5), together with (3.7) and (3.8) , implies
$$
\begin{align}
-v_{l} g_{m} &=\beta V_{k}\left(a_{t+1}, k_{t}\right)-\beta \frac{V_{a}\left(a_{t+1}, k_{t}\right)}{1+\pi_{t+1}} \\
&=V_{a}\left(a_{t}, k_{t-1}\right)\left[1-\beta \frac{V_{a}\left(a_{t+1}, k_{t}\right) / V_{a}\left(a_{t}, k_{t-1}\right)}{1+\pi_{t+1}}\right]\\
&=V_{a}\left(a_{t}, k_{t-1}\right)\left[1-\left(\frac{1}{1+i_{t}}\right)\right] \\
&=V_{a}\left(a_{t}, k_{t-1}\right)\left(\frac{i_{t}}{1+i_{t}}\right) \tag{3.11}
\end{align}
$$
where $ i_{t} $ is the nominal rate of interest and, using (3.7) and (3.8),
$$
\frac{V_{a}\left(a_{t+1}, k_{t}\right)}{V_{a}\left(a_{t}, k_{t-1}\right)}=\frac{1+\pi_{t+1}}{1+i_{t}} \frac{1}{\beta}
$$
Further insight can be gained by using (3.6) and (3.8) to note that (3.11) can also be written as
$$
-w_{t} g_{m}=\frac{i_{t}}{1+i_{t}} \tag{3.12}
$$
The left side of this equation is the value of the transaction time saved by holding additional real money balances. At the optimal level of money holdings, this is just equal to the opportunity cost of holding money, $ i /(1+i) $.

#### Optimal rate of inflation

**Since no social cost of producing money has been introduced, optimality would require that the private marginal product of money, $ g_{m}, $ be driven to zero. Equation (3.12) implies that $ g_{m}=0 $ if and only if $ i=0 $;** one thus obtains the standard result for the optimal rate of inflation, as seen earlier in the MIU model.

#### Evaluation

The chief advantage of the shopping-time approach as a means of motivating the presence of money in the utility function is its use in tying the partials of the utility function with respect to money to the specification of the production function relating money, shopping time, and consumption. But this representation of the medium-of-exchange role of money is also clearly a shortcut. The transaction services production function $ \psi\left(m, n^{s}\right) $ is simply postulated; this approach does not help to determine what constitutes money. Why, for example, do certain types of green paper facilitate transactions (at least in the United States), whereas yellow pieces of paper don't? Section 3.4 reviews models based on search theory that attempt to derive money demand from a more primitive specification of the transaction process.

### 3.2.2 Real Resource Costs

An alternative approach to the CIA or shopping-time models is to **assume that transaction costs take the form of real resources** that are used up in the process of exchange (Brock 1974; 1990 ). An increase in the volume of goods exchanged leads to a rise in transaction costs, whereas higher average real money balances for a given volume of transactions lower costs. In a shopping-time model, these costs are time costs and so enter the utility function indirectly by affecting the time available for leisure.

**If goods must be used up in transacting**, the household's budget constraint must be modified, for example, by adding a **transaction cost term** $ \Upsilon(c, m) $ that depends on the volume of transactions (represented by $ c)$ and the level of money holdings. The budget constraint $ (3.18) $ then becomes
$$
 f\left(k_{t-1}\right)+(1-\delta) k_{t-1}+\tau_{t}+\left(1+r_{t-1}\right) b_{t-1}+\frac{m_{t-1}}{1+\pi_{t}} \geq c_{t}+m_{t}+b_{t}+k_{t}+\Upsilon\left(c_{t}, m_{t}\right) 
$$
Feenstra (1986) considered a variety of transaction costs formulations and showed that they all lead to the presence of a function involving $ c $ and $ m $ appearing on the right side of the budget constraint. He also showed that **transaction costs satisfy the following condition** for all $ c, m \geq 0: \Upsilon $ is twice continuously differentiable and $ \Upsilon \geq 0 $; $ \Upsilon(0, m)=0$; $\Upsilon_{c} \geq 0$; $\Upsilon_{m} \leq 0$; $\Upsilon_{c c}, \Upsilon_{m m} \geq 0$; $\Upsilon_{c m} \leq 0 $; and $ c+\Upsilon(c, m) $ is quasi-convex, with expansion paths having a non-negative slope. These conditions all have intuitive meaning: $ \Upsilon(0, m)=0 $ means that the consumer bears no transaction costs if consumption is zero. The sign restrictions on the partial derivatives reflect the assumptions that transaction costs rise at an increasing rate as consumption increases and that money has positive but diminishing marginal productivity in reducing transaction costs. The assumption that $ \Upsilon_{c m} \leq 0 $ means that the marginal transaction costs of additional consumption do not increase with money holdings. Expansion paths with non-negative slopes imply that $ c+\Upsilon $ increases with income. Positive money holdings can be ensured by the additional assumption that $ \lim _{m \rightarrow 0} \Upsilon_{m}(c, m)=-\infty ; $ that is, money is essential.

Now consider how the MIU approach compares to a transaction cost approach. Suppose a function $ W(x, m) $ has the following properties: for all $ x, m \geq 0 ; W $ is twice continuously differentiable and satisfies $ W \geq 0 ; W(0, m)=0 ; W(x, m) \rightarrow \infty $ as $ x \rightarrow \infty $ for fixed $ m ; W_{m} \geq 0 ; 0 \leq W_{x} \leq 1 ; W_{x x} \leq 0 ; W_{m m} \leq 0 ; W_{x m} \geq 0 ; W $ is quasi-concave with Engel curves with a non-negative slope. **Now simplify by dropping capital and consider the following two static problems representing simple transaction cost and MIU approaches**:
$$
\max U(c) \text{ subject to } c+\Upsilon(c, m)+b+m=y \tag{3.13}
$$
and
$$
\max V(x, m) \text{ subject to } x+b+m=y \tag{3.14}
$$
where $ V(x, m)=U[W(x, m)] . $ These two problems are equivalent if $ \left(c^{*}, b^{*}, m^{*}\right) $ solves $ (3.13) $ if and only if $ \left(x^{*}, b^{*}, m^{*}\right) $ solves $ (3.14) $ with $ x^{*}=c^{*}+\Upsilon\left(c^{*}, m^{*}\right) . $ Feenstra (1986) showed that equivalence holds if the functions $ \Upsilon(c, m) $ and $ W(x, m) $ satisfy the stated conditions.

This "*functional equivalence*" (Wang and Yip 1992) between the transaction cost and MIU approaches suggests that conclusions derived within one framework will also hold under the alternative approach. However, this equivalence is obtained by redefining variables. So, for example, the "consumption" variable $ x $ in the utility function is equal to consumption inclusive of transaction costs (i.e., $ x=c+\Upsilon(c, m)) $ and is therefore not independent of money holdings. At the very least, the appropriate definition of the consumption variable needs to be considered if one attempts to use either framework to draw implications for actual macroeconomic time series. 

## 3.3 CIA Model

A direct approach to generating a role for money, proposed by Clower $ (1967) $ and developed formally by Grandmont and Younes (1972) and Lucas (1980a), captures the role of money as a medium of exchange by **requiring explicitly that money be used to purchase goods**. Such a requirement can also be viewed as replacing the substitution possibilities between time and money highlighted in the shopping-time model with a transaction technology in which shopping time is zero if $ M / P \geq c $ and infinite otherwise (McCallum $ 1990 \mathrm{a}) . $ This specification can be represented by assuming that the individual faces, in addition to a standard budget constraint, a cash-in-advance (CIA) constraint.

**The exact form of the CIA constraint depends on which transactions or purchases are subject to the CIA requirements**. For example, both consumption goods and investment goods might be subject to the requirement. Or only consumption might be subject to the constraint. Or only a subset of all consumption goods may require cash for their purchase. The constraint will also depend on what constitutes cash. Can bank deposits that earn interest, for example, also be used to carry out transactions? The exact specification of the transactions subject to the CIA constraint can be important.

Timing assumptions also are important in CIA models. 

- **In Lucas (1982)**, agents are able to allocate their portfolios between cash and other assets at the start of each period, after observing any current shocks but prior to purchasing goods. This timing is often described by saying that the **asset market opens first and then the goods market opens**. If there is a positive opportunity cost of holding money and the asset market opens first, agents will only hold an amount of money that is just sufficient to finance their desired level of consumption. 
- **In Svensson (1985), the goods market opens first.** This implies that agents have available for spending only the cash carried over from the previous period, and so cash balances must be chosen before agents know how much spending they will wish to undertake. For example, if uncertainty is resolved after money balances are chosen, an agent may find that he is holding cash balances that are too low to finance his desired spending level. Or he may be left with more cash than he needs, thereby forgoing interest income.

To understand the structure of CIA models, the next section reviews a simplified version of a model due to Svensson (1985). The simplification involves eliminating uncertainty. Once the basic framework has been reviewed, however, a stochastic CIA model is considered as a means of studying the role of money in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model in which business cycles are generated by both real productivity shocks and shocks to the growth rate of money. Developing a linearized version of the model will serve to illustrate how the CIA approach differs from the MIU approach discussed in chapter 2. 

### 3.3.1 The Certainty Case

This section develops a simple cash-in-advance model. Issues arising in the presence of uncertainty are postponed until section 3.3.2. The timing of transactions and markets follows Svensson (1985), although the alternative timing used by Lucas (1982) is also discussed. After the model and its equilibrium conditions are set out, the steady state is examined and the welfare costs of inflation in a CIA model are discussed.

#### The Model

Consider the following representative agent model. The agent's objective is to chose a path for consumption and asset holdings to maximize
$$
 \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^{t} u\left(c_{t}\right) \tag{3.15}
$$
for $ 0<\beta<1 $, where $ u(.) $ is bounded, continuously differentiable, strictly increasing, and strictly concave, and the maximization is subject to a sequence of CIA and budget constraints. The agent enters the period with money holdings $ M_{t-1} $ and receives a lump-sum transfer $ T_{t} $ (in nominal terms). If goods markets open first, the CIA constraint takes the form
$$
P_{t} c_{t} \leq M_{t-1}+T_{t}
$$
where $ c $ is real consumption, $ P $ is the aggregate price level, and $ T $ is the nominal lump-sum transfer. In real terms,
$$
c_{t} \leq \frac{M_{t-1}}{P_{t}}+\frac{T_{t}}{P_{t}}=\frac{m_{t-1}}{1+\pi_{t}}+\tau_{t} \tag{3.16}
$$
where $ m_{t-1}=M_{t-1} / P_{t-1}, \pi_{t}=\left(P_{t} / P_{t-1}\right)-1 $ is the inflation rate, and $ \tau_{t}=T_{t} / P_{t} $.

Note the timing: $ M_{t-1} $ refers to nominal money balances chosen by the agent in period $ t-1 $ and carried into period $ t $. The real value of these balances is determined by the period $ t $ price level $ P_{t} . $ Since we have assumed away any uncertainty, the agent knows $ P_{t} $ at the time $ M_{t-1} $ is chosen. This specification of the CIA constraint assumes that income from production during period $ t $ will not be available for consumption purchases until period $ t+1 $. The budget constraint, in nominal terms, is
$$
\begin{align}
P_{t} \omega_{t} & \equiv P_{t} f\left(k_{t-1}\right)+(1-\delta) P_{t} k_{t-1}+M_{t-1}+T_{t}+\left(1+i_{t-1}\right) B_{t-1} \\
& \geq P_{t} c_{t}+P_{t} k_{t}+M_{t}+B_{t} \tag{3.17}
\end{align}
$$
where $ \omega_{t} $ is the agent's time $ t $ *real resources*, consisting of income generated during period $ t f\left(k_{t-1}\right) $, the undepreciated capital stock $ (1-\delta) k_{t-1} $, money holdings, the transfer from the government, and gross nominal interest earnings on the agent's $ t-1 $ holdings of nominal one-period bonds, $ B_{t-1} . $ Physical capital depreciates at the rate $ \delta . $ These resources are used to purchase consumption, capital, bonds, and nominal money holdings that are then carried into period $ t+1 . $ Dividing through by the time $ t $ price level, the **budget constraint** can be rewritten in real terms as
$$
 \omega_{t} \equiv f\left(k_{t-1}\right)+(1-\delta) k_{t-1}+\tau_{t}+\frac{m_{t-1}+\left(1+i_{t-1}\right) b_{t-1}}{1+\pi_{t}} \geq c_{t}+m_{t}+b_{t}+k_{t} \tag{3.18}
$$
where $ m $ and $ b $ are real cash and bond holdings. Note that real resources available to the representative agent in period $ t+1 $ are given by
$$
 \omega_{t+1}=f\left(k_{t}\right)+(1-\delta) k_{t}+\tau_{t+1}+\frac{m_{t}+\left(1+i_{t}\right) b_{t}}{1+\pi_{t+1}} \tag{3.19}
$$
The period $ t $ gross nominal interest rate $ 1+i_{t} $ divided by $ 1+\pi_{t+1} $ is the gross real rate of return from period $ t $ to $ t+1 $ and can be denoted by $ 1+r_{t}=\left(1+i_{t}\right) / $ $ \left(1+\pi_{t+1}\right) . $ With this notation, $ (3.19) $ can be written as
$$
 \omega_{t+1}=f\left(k_{t}\right)+(1-\delta) k_{t}+\tau_{t+1}+\left(1+r_{t}\right) a_{t}-\left(\frac{i_{t}}{1+\pi_{t+1}}\right) m_{t} 
$$

where $ a_{t} \equiv m_{t}+b_{t} $ is the agent's holding of nominal financial assets (money and bonds). This form highlights that there is a cost to holding money when the nominal interest rate is positive. This cost is $ i_{t} /\left(1+\pi_{t+1}\right) $; since this is the cost in terms of period $ t+1 $ real resources, *the discounted cost at time $ t $ of holding an additional unit of money* is $ i_{t} /\left(1+r_{t}\right)\left(1+\pi_{t+1}\right)=i_{t} /\left(1+i_{t}\right) $. This is the same expression for the opportunity cost of money obtained in chapter 2 in an MIU model.

Equation (3.16) is based on the timing convention that goods markets open before asset markets. *The model of Lucas (1982)* assumed the reverse, and **individuals can engage in asset transactions at the start of each period before the goods market has opened**. In the present model, this would mean that the agent enters period $ t $ with financial wealth that can be used to purchase nominal bonds $ B_{t} $ or carried as cash into the goods market to purchase consumption goods. The CIA constraint would then take the form
$$
 c_{t} \leq \frac{m_{t-1}}{1+\pi_{t}}+\tau_{t}-b_{t} . \tag{3.20}
$$
In this case, **the household is able to adjust its portfolio between money and bonds before entering the goods market to purchase consumption goods**.

To understand the implications of this alternative timing, suppose there is a positive opportunity cost of holding money. 

- Then, if the asset market opens first, the agent will only hold an amount of money that is just sufficient to finance the desired level of consumption. Since the opportunity cost of holding $ m $ is positive whenever the nominal interest rate is greater than zero, (3.20) will always hold with equality as long as the nominal rate of interest is positive. 
- When uncertainty is introduced, the CIA constraint may not bind when (3.16) is used and the goods market opens before the asset market. For example, if period $ t^{\prime} $ s income is uncertain and is realized after $ M_{t-1} $ has been chosen, a bad income realization may cause the agent to reduce consumption to a point where the CIA constraint is no longer binding. Or a disturbance that causes an unexpected price decline might, by increasing the real value of the agent's money holdings, result in a nonbinding constraint. $ { }^{10} $ 

**Since a nonstochastic environment holds in this section, the CIA constraint will bind under either timing assumption if the opportunity cost of holding money is positive.** For a complete discussion and comparison of alternative assumptions about the timing of the asset and goods markets, see Salyer (1991). In the remainder of this chapter, **we shall follow Svensson (1985) in using (3.16) and assume that consumption in period $ t $ is limited by the cash carried over from period $ t-1 $ plus any net transfer**.

The *choice variables* at time $ t $ are $ c_{t}, m_{t}, b_{t} $, and $ k_{t} . $ An individual agent's state at time $ t $ can be characterized by her resources $ \omega_{t} $ and her real cash holdings $ m_{t-1} ; $ both are relevant because consumption choice is constrained by the agent's resources and by cash holdings. To analyze the agent's decision problem, one can define the value function
$$
 V\left(\omega_{t}, m_{t-1}\right)=\max _{c_{t}, k_{t}, b_{t}, m_{t}}\left\{u\left(c_{t}\right)+\beta V\left(\omega_{t+1}, m_{t}\right)\right\} \tag{3.21}
$$
where the maximization is subject to the budget constraint (from 3.18)
$$
 \omega_{t} \geq c_{t}+m_{t}+b_{t}+k_{t} \tag{3.22}
$$
the CIA constraint $ (3.16) $, and the definition of $ \omega_{t+1} $ given by $ (3.19) . $ Using this expression for $ \omega_{t+1} $ in $ (3.21) $ and letting $ \lambda_{t}\left(\mu_{t}\right) $ denote the Lagrangian multiplier associated with *the budget constraint (the CIA constraint)*, the first-order necessary conditions for the agent's choice of consumption, capital, bond, and money holdings take the form
$$
\begin{align}
u_{c}\left(c_{t}\right)-\lambda_{t}-\mu_{t}&=0 \tag{3.23}\\
\beta\left[f_{k}\left(k_{t}\right)+1-\delta\right] V_{\omega}\left(\omega_{t+1}, m_{t}\right)-\lambda_{t}&=0  \tag{3.24}\\
\beta\left(1+r_{t}\right) V_{\omega}\left(\omega_{t+1}, m_{t}\right)-\lambda_{t}&=0 \tag{3.25}\\
\beta\left[1+r_{t}-\frac{i_{t}}{1+\pi_{t+1}}\right] V_{\omega}\left(\omega_{t+1}, m_{t}\right)+\beta V_{m}\left(\omega_{t+1}, m_{t}\right)-\lambda_{t}&=0 \tag{3.26}
\end{align}
$$
From the envelope theorem,
$$
\begin{align}
& V_{\omega}\left(\omega_{t}, m_{t-1}\right)=\lambda_{t} \tag{3.27}\\
& V_{m}\left(\omega_{t}, m_{t-1}\right)=\left(\frac{1}{1+\pi_{t}}\right) \mu_{t} \tag{3.28}
\end{align}
$$
From $ (3.27), \lambda_{t} $ is equal to the marginal utility of wealth. According to $ (3.23) $, the marginal utility of consumption exceeds the marginal utility of wealth by the value of liquidity services, $ \mu_{t} . $ The individual must hold money in order to purchase consumption, so the "cost," to which the marginal utility of consumption is set equal, is the marginal utility of wealth plus the cost of the liquidity services needed to finance the transaction.(Equation (3.23) can be compared to (3.10) from the shopping-time model)

In terms of $ \lambda,(3.25) $ becomes
$$
\lambda_{t}=\beta\left(1+r_{t}\right) \lambda_{t+1} \tag{3.29}
$$
which is a standard asset pricing equation and is a familiar condition from problems involving intertemporal optimization. Along the optimal path, **the marginal cost (in terms of today's utility) from reducing wealth slightly, $ \lambda_{t} $, must equal the utility value of carrying that wealth forward one period**, earning a gross real return $ 1+r_{t} $, where tomorrow's utility is discounted back to today at the rate $ \beta ; $ that is, $ \lambda_{t}=\beta\left(1+r_{t}\right) \lambda_{t+1} $ along the optimal path. 

Using (3.27) and (3.28), the first-order condition (3.26) can be expressed as
$$
 \lambda_{t}=\beta\left(\frac{\lambda_{t+1}+\mu_{t+1}}{1+\pi_{t+1}}\right) \tag{3.30}
$$
Equation (3.30) can also be interpreted as an asset pricing equation for money. The price of a unit of money in terms of goods is just $ 1 / P_{t} $ at time $ t $; its value in utility terms is $ \lambda_{t} / P_{t} $. Now, by dividing (3.30) through by $ P_{t} $, it can be rewritten as $ \lambda_{t} / P_{t}= $ $ \beta\left(\lambda_{t+1} / P_{t+1}+\mu_{t+1} / P_{t+1}\right) . $ Solving this equation forward implies that
$$
 \frac{\lambda_{t}}{P_{t}}=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \beta^{i}\left(\frac{\mu_{t+i}}{P_{t+i}}\right) . \tag{3.31}
$$
From (3.28), $ \mu_{t+i} / P_{t+i} $ is equal to $ V_{m}\left(\omega_{t+i}, m_{t+i-1}\right) / P_{t+i-1} $. This last expression, though, is just the partial of the value function with respect to time $ t+i-1 $ nominal money balances:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial V\left(\omega_{t+i}, m_{t+i-1}\right)}{\partial M_{t+i-1}} &=V_{m}\left(\omega_{t+i}, m_{t+i-1}\right)\left(\frac{\partial m_{t+i-1}}{\partial M_{t+i-1}}\right) \\
&=\frac{V_{m}\left(\omega_{t+i}, m_{t+i-1}\right)}{P_{t+i-1}} \\
&=\left(\frac{\mu_{t+i}}{P_{t+i}}\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$
This means (3.31) can be rewritten as
$$
\frac{\lambda_{t}}{P_{t}}=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \beta^{i} \frac{\partial V\left(\omega_{t+i}, m_{t+i-1}\right)}{\partial M_{t+i-1}}
$$
In other words, **the current value of money in terms of utility is equal to the present value of the marginal utility of money in all future periods**. Equation $ (3.31) $ is an interesting result; it says that money is just like any other asset in the sense that its value (i.e., its price today) can be thought of as equal to the present discounted value of the stream of returns generated by the asset. In the case of money, these returns take the form of liquidity services. If the CIA constraint were not binding, these liquidity services would not have value $ \left(\mu=V_{m}=0\right) $ and neither would money. But if the constraint is binding, then money has value because it yields valued liquidity services.

The result that the value of money, $ \lambda / P $, satisfies an asset pricing relationship is not unique to the CIA approach. For example, a similar relationship is implied by the MIU approach. The model employed in the analysis of the MIU approach (see chapter 2) implied that
$$
 \frac{\lambda_{t}}{P_{t}}=\beta\left(\frac{\lambda_{t+1}}{P_{t+1}}\right)+\frac{u_{m}\left(c_{t}, m_{t}\right)}{P_{t}} 
$$
which can be solved forward to yield
$$
 \frac{\lambda_{t}}{P_{t}}=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \beta^{i}\left[\frac{u_{m}\left(c_{t+i}, m_{t+i}\right)}{P_{t+i}}\right] 
$$
Here, the marginal utility of money $ u_{m} $ plays a role exactly analogous to that played by the Lagrangian on the CIA constraint $ \mu $. The one difference is that in the MIU approach, $ m_{t} $ yields utility at time $ t $, whereas in the CIA approach, the value of money accumulated at time $ t $ is measured by $ \mu_{t+1} $ because the cash cannot be used to purchase consumption goods until period $ t+1 .^{16} $

An expression for the nominal rate of interest can be obtained by using $ (3.29) $ and $ (3.30) $ to obtain $ \lambda_{t}=\beta\left(1+r_{t}\right) \lambda_{t+1}=\beta\left(\lambda_{t+1}+\mu_{t+1}\right) /\left(1+\pi_{t+1}\right) $, or $ \left(1+r_{t}\right)\left(1+\pi_{t+1}\right) \lambda_{t+1}=\left(\lambda_{t+1}+\mu_{t+1}\right) $. Since $ 1+i_{t}=\left(1+r_{t}\right)\left(1+\pi_{t+1}\right) $, the nominal interest rate is given by
$$
i_{t}=\left(\frac{\lambda_{t+1}+\mu_{t+1}}{\lambda_{t+1}}\right)-1=\frac{\mu_{t+1}}{\lambda_{t+1}} \tag{3.32}
$$
Thus, **the nominal rate of interest is positive if and only if money yields liquidity services** $ \left(\mu_{t+1}>0\right) $. In particular, **if the nominal interest rate is positive, the CIA constraint is binding** $ (\mu>0) $.

One can use the relationship between the nominal rate of interest and the Lagrangian multipliers to rewrite the expression for the marginal utility of consumption, given in $ (3.23) $, as
$$
 u_{c}=\lambda(1+\mu / \lambda)=\lambda(1+i) \geq \lambda . \tag{3.33}
$$
Since $ \lambda $ represents the marginal value of income, **the marginal utility of consumption exceeds that of income whenever the nominal interest rate is positive**. Even though the economy's technology allows output to be directly transformed into consumption, the "price" of consumption is not equal to 1 ; it is $ 1+i $ because the household must hold money to finance consumption. Thus, in this CIA model, **a positive nominal interest rate acts as a tax on consumption**; it raises the price of consumption above its production cost(In the shopping-time model, consumption is also taxed).

The CIA constraint holds with equality when the nominal rate of interest is positive, so $ c_{t}=M_{t-1} / P_{t}+\tau_{t} . $ Since the **lump-sum monetary transfer** $ \tau_{t} $ is equal to $ \left(M_{t}-M_{t-1}\right) / P_{t} $, this implies that $ c_{t}=M_{t} / P_{t}=m_{t} . $ Consequently, the consumption velocity of money is identically equal to 1 (velocity $ \left.=P_{t} c_{t} / M_{t}=1\right) $. Since actual velocity varies over time, CIA models have been modified in ways that break this tight link between $ c $ and $ m . $

- **One way to avoid this is to introduce uncertainty** (see Svensson 1985 ). If money balances have to be chosen prior to the resolution of uncertainty, it may turn out after the realizations of shocks that the desired level of consumption is less than the amount of real money balances being held. In this case, some money balances will be unspent, and velocity can be less than $ 1 . $ 
- Velocity may also vary if the CIA constraint only applies to a subset of consumption goods. Then variations in the rate of inflation can lead to substitution between goods whose purchase requires cash and those whose purchase does not (see problem 6 at the end of this chapter).

#### The Steady State 

In the steady state, $ (3.29) $ implies that $ \left(1+r^{s s}\right)=1 / \beta $, and $ i=\left(1+\pi^{s s}\right) / \beta-1 \approx $ $ 1 / \beta-1+\pi^{s s} . $ In addition, $ (3.24) $ gives the steady-state capital stock as the solution to
$$
 f_{k}\left(k^{s s}\right)=r^{s s}+\delta=\frac{1}{\beta}-1+\delta 
$$
So this CIA model, like the Sidrauski MIU model, exhibits **superneutrality**. 

1. The steady-state capital stock depends only on the time preference parameter $ \beta $, the rate of depreciation $ \delta $, and the production function. It is independent of the rate of inflation. 
2. Since steady-state consumption is equal to $ f\left(k^{s s}\right)-\delta k^{s s} $, it too is independent of the rate of inflation.

From (3.33), it has been shown that the marginal utility of consumption could be written as the marginal utility of wealth $ (\lambda) $ times 1 plus the nominal rate of interest, reflecting the opportunity cost of holding the money required to purchase goods for consumption. Using $ (3.32) $, the ratio of the liquidity value of money, measured by the Lagrangian multiplier $ \mu $, to the marginal utility of consumption is
$$
 \frac{\mu}{u_{c}}=\frac{\mu}{\lambda(1+i)}=\frac{i}{1+i} 
$$
This expression is exactly **parallel to the result in the MIU framework**, where the ratio of the marginal utility of money to the marginal utility of consumption was equal to the nominal interest rate divided by 1 plus the nominal rate, that is, the relative price of money in terms of consumption.

**With the CIA constraint binding, real consumption is equal to real money balances. In the steady state, constant consumption implies that the stock of nominal money balances and the price level must be changing at the same rate**. Define $ \theta $ as the growth rate of the nominal quantity of money (so that $ \left.T_{t}=\theta M_{t-1}\right) ; $ then
$$
 \pi^{s s}=\theta^{s s} . 
$$
**The steady-state inflation rate is, as usual, determined by the rate of growth of the nominal money stock**.

One difference between the CIA model and the MIU model is that with $ c^{s s} $ independent of inflation and the cash-in-advance constraint binding, the fact that $ c^{s s}=m^{s s} $ in the CIA model implies that **steady-state money holdings are also independent of inflation**.

#### The Welfare Costs of Inflation 

The CIA model, because it is based explicitly on behavioral relationships consistent with utility maximization, can be used to assess the welfare costs of inflation and to determine the optimal rate of inflation. The MIU approach had very strong implications for the optimal inflation rate. Steady-state utility of the representative household was maximized when the nominal rate of interest equaled zero. It has already been suggested that this conclusion continues to hold when money produces transaction services.

**In the basic CIA model, however, there is no optimal rate of inflation that maximizes the steady-state welfare of the representative household**. The reason follows directly from the specification of utility as a function only of consumption and the result that consumption is independent of the rate of inflation (**superneutrality**). Steady-state welfare is equal to
$$
 \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^{t} u\left(c^{s s}\right)=\frac{u\left(c^{s s}\right)}{1-\beta} 
$$
and is invariant to the inflation rate. Comparing across steady states, any inflation rate is as good as any other. $ ^{19} $

**This finding is not robust to modifications in the basic CIA model**. In particular, once the model is extended to incorporate a labor-leisure choice, consumption will no longer be independent of the inflation rate, and there will be a well-defined optimal rate of inflation. Because leisure can be "purchased" without the use of money (i.e., leisure is not subject to the CIA constraint), variations in the rate of inflation will affect the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure (see section 3.3.2). With different inflation rates leading to different levels of steady-state consumption and leisure, steady-state utility will be a function of inflation. This type of substitution plays an important role in the model of Cooley and Hansen (1989), discussed in the next section; in their model, inflation leads to an increased demand for leisure and a reduction in labor supply. But **before including a labor-leisure choice, it will be useful to briefly review some other modifications of the basic CIA model**, modifications that will, in general, generate a unique optimal rate of inflation.

- **Cash and Credit Goods**: Lucas and Stokey (1983; 1987) introduced the idea that the CIA constraint may only apply to a subset of consumption goods. They modeled this by assuming that the representative agent's utility function is defined over consumption of two types of goods: "cash"' goods and "credit' goods. In this case, paralleling (3.23), the marginal utility of cash goods is equated to $ \lambda+\mu \geq \lambda $, and the marginal utility of credit goods is equated to $ \lambda $. Hence, the CIA requirement for cash goods drives a wedge between the marginal utilities of the two types of goods. It is exactly as if the consumer faced a tax of $ \mu / \lambda=i $ on purchases of the cash good. Higher inflation, by raising the opportunity cost of holding cash, serves to raise the tax on cash goods and generates a substitution away from the cash good and toward the credit good. (See also Hartley $ 1988 . $)
    - The obvious difficulty with this approach is that the classifications of goods into cash and credit goods is exogenous. And it is common to assume a one-good technology so that the goods are not differentiated by any technological considerations. The advantage of these models is that they can produce time variation in velocity. Recall that in the basic CIA model, any equilibrium with a positive nominal rate of interest is characterized by a binding CIA constraint, and this means that $ c=m . $ With both cash and credit goods, $ m $ will equal the consumption of cash goods, allowing the ratio of total consumption to money holdings to vary with expected inflation.
- **CIA and Investment Goods**: A second modification to the basic model involves extending the CIA constraint to cover investment goods. In this case, the **inflation tax applies to both consumption and investment goods**. Higher rates of inflation will tend to discourage capital accumulation, and Stockman (1981) showed that higher inflation would lower the steady-state capital-labor ratio (see also Abel 1985 and problem 9 at the end of this chapter):

Implications for Optimal Inflation In CIA models, inflation acts as a tax on goods or activities whose purchase requires cash. This tax then introduces a distortion by creating a wedge between the marginal rates of transformation implied by the economy's technology and the marginal rates of substitution faced by consumers. Since the CIA model, like the MIU model, offers no reason for such a distortion to be introduced (there is no inefficiency that calls for Pigovian taxes or subsidies on particular activities, and the government's revenue needs can be met through lump-sum taxation), **optimality calls for setting the inflation tax equal to zero**. The inflation tax is directly related to the nominal rate of interest; **a zero inflation tax is achieved when the nominal rate of interest is equal to zero**.

### 3.3.2 A Stochastic CIA Model 

While the models of Lucas (1982), Svensson (1985), and Lucas and Stokey (1987) provide theoretical frameworks for assessing the role of inflation on asset prices and interest rates, they do not provide any guide to the empirical magnitude of inflation effects or to the welfare costs of inflation. What one would like is a dynamic equilibrium model that could be simulated under alternative monetary policies - for example, for alternative steady-state rates of inflation-in order to assess quantitatively.

the effects of inflation. Such an exercise was first conducted by Cooley and Hansen (1989; 1991). Cooley and Hansen followed the basic framework of Lucas and Stokey(1987). However, important aspects of their specification include

1. the introduction of capital and, consequently, an investment decision; 
2. the introduction of a laborleisure choice; 
3. and the identification of **consumption as the cash good and investment and leisure as credit goods**.

**Inflation represents a tax on the purchases of the cash good**, and therefore higher rates of inflation shift household demand away from the cash good and toward the credit good. In Cooley and Hansen's formulation, this implies that higher inflation increases the demand for leisure. One effect of higher inflation, then, is to reduce the supply of labor. This then reduces output, consumption, investment, and the steady state capital stock.

Cooley and Hansen expressed **welfare losses across steady states in terms of the consumption increase (as a percentage of output) required to yield the same utility as would arise if the CIA constraint were nonbinding**. For a 10 percent inflation rate, they reported a welfare cost of inflation of $ 0.387 $ percent of output if the CIA constraint is assumed to apply at a quarterly time interval. Not surprisingly, if the constraint binds only at a monthly time interval, the cost falls to $ 0.112 $ percent of output. These costs are small. For much higher rates of inflation, they start to look significant. For example, with a monthly time period for the CIA constraint, a 400 percent annual rate of inflation generates a welfare loss equal to $ 2.137 $ percent of output. The welfare costs of inflation are discussed further in chapter 4 .

#### The Basic Model

To model the behavior of the representative agent faced with uncertainty and a CIA constraint, assume the agent's objective is to maximize
$$
 \mathrm{E}_{t} \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \beta^{i} u\left(c_{t+i}, 1-n_{t+i}\right)=\mathrm{E}_{0} \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \beta^{i}\left[\frac{c_{t+i}^{1-\Phi}}{1-\Phi}+\Psi \frac{\left(1-n_{t+i}\right)^{1-\eta}}{1-\eta}\right] \tag{3.34}
$$
with $ 0<\beta<1 $. Here $ c_{t} $ is real consumption, and $ n_{t} $ is labor supplied to market activities, expressed as a fraction of the total time available, so that $ 1-n_{t} $ is equal to leisure time. $ { }^{23} $ The parameters $ \Phi, \Psi $, and $ \eta $ are restricted to be positive.

Households supply labor and rent capital to firms that produce goods. The household enters each period with nominal money balances $ M_{t-1} $ and receives a nominal lump-sum transfer equal to $ T_{t} $. In the aggregate, this transfer is related to the growth rate of the nominal supply of money. Letting the stochastic variable $ \theta_{t} $ denote the rate of money growth $ \left(M_{t}=\left(1+\theta_{t}\right) M_{t-1}\right) $, the per capita transfer will equal $ \theta_{t} M_{t-1} $ At the start of period $ t, \theta_{t} $ is known to all households. Households purchase bonds $ B_{t} $, and their remaining cash is available for purchasing consumption goods. Thus, the timing has **asset markets opening first**, and the *CIA constraint*, which is taken to **apply only to the purchase of consumption goods**, takes the form
$$
 P_{t} c_{t} \leq M_{t-1}+T_{t}-B_{t} ,
$$
where $ P_{t} $ is the time $ t $ price level. Note that time $ t $ transfers are available to be spent in period $ t $. In real terms, the CIA constraint becomes
$$
 c_{t} \leq \frac{m_{t-1}}{1+\pi_{t}}+\tau_{t}-b_{t} \tag{3.35}
$$
Here $ 1+\pi_{t} $ is equal to 1 plus the rate of inflation. The CIA constraint will always be binding if the nominal interest rate is positive. $ { }^{24} $

In addition to the CIA constraint, the household faces a **flow budget constraint** in nominal terms of the form
$$
 M_{t}=P_{t}\left[Y_{t}+(1-\delta) K_{t-1}-K_{t}\right]+\left(1+i_{t}\right) B_{t}+\left(M_{t-1}+T_{t}-P_{t} c_{t}-B_{t}\right) . 
$$
In real terms, this becomes
$$
m_{t}=y_{t}+(1-\delta) k_{t-1}+i_{t} b_{t}-k_{t}+\frac{m_{t-1}}{1+\pi_{t}}+\tau_{t}-c_{t} \tag{3.36}
$$
where $ 0 \leq \delta \leq 1 $ is the depreciation rate. The individual's decision problem is characterized by the value function
$$
 V\left(k_{t-1}, b_{t-1}, m_{t-1}\right)=\max _{c_{t}, n_{t}, k_{t}, b_{t}, m_{t}}\left[\frac{c_{t}^{1-\Phi}}{1-\Phi}+\Psi \frac{\left(1-n_{t}\right)^{1-\eta}}{1-\eta}+\beta \mathrm{E}_{t} V\left(k_{t}, b_{t}, m_{t}\right)\right] 
$$
where the maximization is **subject to the constraints $ (3.36) $ and $ (3.35) $.** The first-order conditions for the representative agent's decision problem must be satisfied in equilibrium. If $ \lambda_{t} $ is the Lagrangian multiplier on the budget constraint and $ \mu_{t} $ is the multiplier on the cash-in-advance constraint, then these *first-order conditions* take the form
$$
\begin{align}
& c_{t}^{-\Phi}=\lambda_{t}+\mu_{t} \tag{3.37} \\
& \Psi(1-n)^{-\eta}=(1-\alpha)\left(\frac{y_{t}}{n_{t}}\right) \lambda_{t} \tag{3.38}\\
& \lambda_{t}=\beta \mathrm{E}_{t}\left(1+r_{t}\right) \lambda_{t+1} \tag{3.39}\\
& i_{t} \lambda_{t}-\mu_{t}=0 \tag{3.40}\\
& \lambda_{t}=\beta \mathrm{E}_{t}\left[\frac{\lambda_{t+1}+\mu_{t+1}}{1+\pi_{t+1}}\right] \tag{3.41}
\end{align}
$$
where $ r_{t}=\alpha\left(y_{t+1} / k_{t}\right)-\delta $.

To complete the specification of the model, assume the economy's technology is given by a Cobb-Douglas constant-returns-to-scale production function, expressed in per capita terms as
$$
 y_{t}=e^{z_{t}} k_{t-1}^{\alpha} n_{t}^{1-\alpha} \tag{3.42}
$$
where $ 0 \leq \alpha \leq 1 . $ The exogenous productivity *shock* $ z_{t} $ is assumed to follow an AR(1) process:
$$
 z_{t}=\rho_{z} z_{t-1}+e_{t} 
$$
with $ 0 \leq \rho \leq 1 $. The innovation $ e_{t} $ has mean zero and variance $ \sigma_{e}^{2} $. Finally, let $ u_{t}=\theta_{t}-\theta^{s s} $ be the deviation of money growth from its steady-state average rate and assume
$$
u_{t}=\rho_{u} u_{t-1}+\phi z_{t-1}+\varphi_{t},
$$
where $ \varphi_{t} $ is a white noise innovation with variance $ \sigma_{\varphi}^{2} . $ This is the same process for the nominal growth rate of money that was used in chapter $ 2 . $

#### The Steady State 

Adopting the same parameter calibrations as those reported in section $ 2.5 .4 $ for the MIU model, the steady-state values of the ratios that were reported for the MIU model are also the steady-state values for the CIA model (see the chapter appendix). The Euler condition ensures $ 1+r^{s s}=1 / \beta $, which then implies $ y^{s s} / k^{s s}=\left(r^{s s}+\delta\right) / \alpha $ and, with investment in the steady state equal to $ \delta k^{s s}, c^{s s} / k^{s s}=\left(y^{s s} / k^{s s}\right)-\delta . $ Even though the method used to generate a demand for money has changed with the move from the MIU model to the CIA model, the steady-state values of the outputcapital and consumption-capital ratios are unchanged. Note that none of these steadystate ratios depends on the growth rate of the nominal money supply. The level of real money balances in the steady state is then determined by the cash-in-advance constraint, which is binding as long as the nominal rate of interest is positive. Hence, $ c^{s s}=m^{s s} /\left(1+\pi^{s s}\right)+\tau^{s s}=m^{s s} $, so $ m^{s s} / k^{s s}=c^{s s} / k^{s s} . $

The steady-state labor supply will depend on the money growth rate and therefore on the rate of inflation. The appendix shows that $ n^{s s} $ satisfies
$$
 \left(1-n^{s s}\right)^{-\eta}\left(n^{s s}\right)^{\Phi}=\left(\frac{1-\alpha}{\Psi}\right)\left(\frac{\beta}{1+\theta^{s s}}\right)\left(\frac{y^{s s}}{k^{s s}}\right)^{(\Phi-\alpha) /(1-\alpha)}\left(\frac{c^{s s}}{k^{s s}}\right)^{-\Phi} \tag{3.43}
$$
where $ \theta $ is the steady-state rate of money growth. Since the left side of this expression is increasing in $ n^{s s} $, a rise in $ \theta^{s s} $, which implies a rise in the inflation rate, lowers the steady-state labor supply. **Higher inflation taxes consumption and causes households to substitute toward more leisure**. This is the source of the welfare cost of inflation in this CIA model. The elasticity of labor supply with respect to the growth rate of money is negative. 

It is useful to note the similarity between the expression for steady-state labor supply in the CIA model and the corresponding expression (given in (2.77) in chapter 2) that was obtained in the MIU model. With the MIU specification, faster money growth had an ambiguous effect on the supply of labor. With the calibrated values of the parameters of the utility function used in chapter 2, money and consumption were complements, so higher inflation, by reducing real money holdings, lowered the marginal utility of consumption and also reduced the supply of labor.

#### Dynamics 

The dynamic implications of the CIA model can be explored by obtaining a firstorder linear approximation around the steady state. The derivation of the approximation is contained in the chapter appendix. As in chapter 2, a variable $ \hat{x} $ *denotes the percentage deviation of $ x $ around the steady state*(The exceptions again being that $ \hat{r} $ and $ \hat{i} $ are expressed in percentage terms $ \left(\right. $ e.g., $ \left.\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}_{t}=r_{t}-r_{t}^{s s}\right) $.). The CIA model can be approximated around the steady state by the following nine linear equations:
$$
\begin{align}
& \hat{y}_{t}=\alpha \hat{k}_{t-1}+(1-\alpha) \hat{n}_{t}+z_{t} \tag{3.44}\\
& \left(\frac{y^{s s}}{k^{s s}}\right) \hat{y}_{t}=\left(\frac{c^{s s}}{k^{s s}}\right) \hat{c}_{t}+\hat{k}_{t}-(1-\delta) \hat{k}_{t-1} \tag{3.45}\\
& \hat{y}_{t}+\hat{\lambda}_{t}=\left(1+\eta \frac{n^{s s}}{1-n^{s s}}\right) \hat{n}_{t} \tag{3.46}\\
& \hat{r}_{t}=\alpha\left(\frac{y^{s s}}{k^{s s}}\right)\left(\mathrm{E}_{t} \hat{y}_{t+1}-\hat{k}_{t}\right) \tag{3.47}\\
& \hat{\lambda}_{t}=\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}_{t}+\mathrm{E}_{t} \hat{\lambda}_{t+1} \tag{3.48} \\
& -\Phi \hat{c}_{t}=\hat{\lambda}_{t}+\hat{\imath}_{t} \tag{3.49}\\
& \hat{\lambda}_{t}=-\Phi \mathrm{E}_{t} \hat{c}_{t+1}-\mathrm{E}_{t} \hat{\pi}_{t+1} \tag{3.50}\\
& \hat{c}_{t}=\hat{m}_{t} \tag{3.51}\\
& \hat{m}_{t}=\hat{m}_{t-1}-\hat{\pi}_{t}+u_{t} \tag{3.52}
\end{align}
$$
Note that the first five equations (the production function, the resource constraint, the labor-leisure condition, the marginal product of capital equation, and the Euler condition) are identical to those found with the MIU approach. The critical differences between the two approaches appear in a comparison of $ (3.49),(3.50) $, and (3.51) with $ (2.65) $ and $ (2.73) $ of chapter $ 2 . $ In the MIU model, utility depended directly on money holdings, so $ (2.65) $ expressed the marginal utility of consumption in terms of $ \hat{c}_{t} $ and $ \hat{m}_{t} . $ In the CIA model, the marginal utility of income can differ from the marginal utility of consumption; (3.50) reflects the fact that an extra dollar of income received in period $ t $ cannot be spent on consumption until $ t+1 $. Equation $ (3.41) $ gives $ \lambda_{t}=\beta \mathrm{E}_{t}\left(\lambda_{t+1}+\mu_{t+1}\right) /\left(1+\pi_{t+1}\right) .^{26} $ Since the marginal utility of consumption $ c_{t}^{-\Phi} $ is equated to $ \lambda_{t}+\mu_{t} $, this becomes $ \lambda_{t}=\beta \mathrm{E}_{t} c_{t+1}^{-\Phi} /\left(1+\pi_{t+1}\right)=  \beta \mathrm{E}_{t} m_{t+1}^{-\Phi} /\left(1+\pi_{t+1}\right) . $ Linearizing this result produces $ (3.50) . $ Equation $ (2.73) $ was the MIU money demand condition derived from the first-order condition for the household's holdings of real money balances. In the CIA model, $ (3.49) $ and $ (3.51) $ reflect the presence of the nominal interest rate as a tax on consumption and the binding cash-in-advance constraint in the CIA model. Finally, note that $ (3.48)-(3.50) $ can be combined to yield the Fisher equation: $ \hat{\imath}_{t}=\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}_{t}+\mathrm{E}_{t} \hat{\pi}_{t+1} $.

#### Calibration and Simulations 

In order to assess the effects of money in this CIA model, values must be assigned to the specific parameters; that is, the model must be calibrated. The steady state depends on the values of $ \alpha, \beta, \delta, \eta, \Psi $, and $ \Phi $. The baseline values reported in section 2.5.4 for the MIU model can be employed for the CIA model as well. This implies that $ \alpha=0.36, \beta=0.989 $, and $ \delta=0.019 $. Assuming $ \eta=1 $ implies that the utility is log-linear in leisure. The value of $ \Psi $ is then determined so that the steady-state value of $ n $ is $ 0.31 $. For the baseline parameters, this yields $ \Psi=1.34 $. To maintain comparability with the MIU model, the utility function parameter $ \Phi $ will be set equal to 2 for the baseline solutions. The remaining parameters are set to the same values reported in section $ 2.5 .4 $.

Recall that the MIU model displayed short-run dynamics in which the real variables such as output, consumption, capital stock, and employment were independent of the nominal money supply process when utility was log-linear in consumption and money balances. $ ^{27} $ While $ \hat{m} $ does not directly enter the utility function in the CIA model, note that in the case of log utility in consumption (that is, when $ \Phi=1 $ ), the short-run real dynamics in the CIA model are not independent of the process followed by $ \hat{m} $, as they were in the MIU model. Note that $ (3.46),(3.50) $, and $ (3.52) $ imply, when $ \Phi=1 $, that
$$
 \hat{\lambda}_{t}=-\mathrm{E}_{t}\left(\hat{m}_{t+1}+\hat{\pi}_{t+1}\right)=-\left(\hat{m}_{t}+\mathrm{E}_{t} u_{t+1}\right)=\left(1+\eta \frac{n^{s s}}{l^{s s}}\right) \hat{n}_{t}-\hat{y}_{t}
$$
Thus, variations in the expected future growth rate of money, $ \mathrm{E}_{t} u_{t+1} $, force adjustment to either $ \hat{y}, \hat{c}(\hat{m}) $, or $ \hat{n} $ (or all three). In particular, for given output and consumption, higher expected money growth (and therefore higher expected inflation) produces a fall in $ \hat{n}_{t} . $ This is the effect by which higher inflation reduces labor supply and output.

The current growth rate of the nominal money stock, $ u_{t} $, and the current rate of inflation, $ \pi_{t} $, only appear in the form $ u_{t}-\pi_{t}( $ see $ (3.52)) . $ Hence, as in the MIU model, unanticipated monetary shocks affect only current inflation and have no real effects unless they alter expectations of future money growth (i.e., unless $ \mathrm{E}_{t} u_{t+1} $ is affected).

The response of money growth to productivity shocks has real effects, and the economy's response to a productivity shock is decreasing in $ \phi . $ For example, when $ \phi $ is negative, a positive productivity shock implies that money growth will decline in the future. Consequently, expected inflation also declines. The resulting reduction in the nominal interest rate lowers the effective inflation tax on consumption and increases labor supply. In contrast, when $ \phi $ is positive, a positive productivity shock increases expected inflation and reduces labor supply. This tends to partially offset the effect of the productivity shock on output. Thus, output variability is less when $ \phi $ is positive than when it is zero or negative. However, the effects are small; as $ \phi $ goes from $ -0.15 $ to 0 to $ 0.15 $, the standard deviation of output falls from $ 1.57 $ to $ 1.50 $ to $ 1.43 . $

The response of the nominal interest rate is shown in figure $ 3.1 . $ As with the MIU model, a positive money growth shock, by raising expected inflation when $ \rho_{u}>0 $, raises the nominal rate of interest. Greater persistence of the money growth rate process leads to larger movements in expected inflation in response to a monetary shock. This, in turn, produces larger adjustments of labor supply and output. As illustrated in figure 3.2, a one-unit positive shock, by raising the expected rate of inflation and thereby increasing the inflation tax on consumption, induces a substitution toward leisure that lowers labor supply. When $ \rho_{u}=0.75 $, employment falls by 7 percent. Comparing this figure with figure $ 2.3 $ reveals that a money growth shock has a much larger real impact in the CIA model than in the MIU model.

## 3.4 Search

Both the MIU and the CIA approaches are useful alternatives for introducing money into a general equilibrium framework. However, **neither approach is very specific about the exact role played by money**. 

- MIU models assume that the direct utility yielded by money proxies for the services money produces in facilitating transactions. However, the nature of these transactions and, more important, the resource costs they might involve, and how these costs might be reduced by holding money, are not specified. 
- Use of the CIA model is motivated by appealing to the idea that some form of nominal asset is required to facilitate transactions. Yet the constraint used is extreme, implying that there are no alternative means of carrying out certain transactions. The CIA constraint is meant to capture the essential role of money as a medium of exchange, but in this case one might wish to start from a specification of the transactions technology to understand why some commodities and assets serve as money and others do not.

**A number of papers have employed search theory to motivate the development of media of exchange**; this has been one of the most active areas of monetary theory (examples include Jones 1976; Diamond 1983; Kiyotaki and Wright $ 1989 ; 1993 $; Oh 1989 ; Trejos and Wright 1993; 1995; Ritter 1995; Shi 1995; Rupert, Schindler, and Wright 2001; Lagos and Wright 2005; Rocheteau and Wright (2005); and the papers in the May 2005 issue of the International Economic Review). In these models, individual agents must exchange the goods they produce (or with which they are endowed) for the goods they consume. During each period, individuals randomly meet other agents; exchange takes place if it is mutually beneficial. In a barter economy, exchange is possible only if an agent holding good $ i $ and wishing to consume good $ j $ (call this an $ i j $ agent) meets an individual holding good $ j $ who wishes to consume good $ i $ (a ji agent). This requirement is known as the double coincident of wants and limits the feasibility of direct barter exchange when production is highly specialized. Trade could occur if agent $ i j $ meets a $ k i $ agent for $ k \neq j $ as long as exchange of goods is costless and the probability of meeting a $ j k $ agent is the same as meeting a $ j i $ agent. In this case, agent $ i j $ would be willing to exchange $ i $ for $ k $ (thereby becoming an $ k j $ agent $ ) $.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210430113439.png)

In the basic *Kiyotaki-Wright model*, **direct exchange of commodities is assumed to be costly, but there exists a fiat money that can be traded costlessly for commodities**. The assumption that there exists money with certain exchange properties (costless trade with commodities) serves a role similar to that of putting money directly into the utility function in the MIU approach or specifying that money must be used in certain types of transactions in the CIA approach. $ ^{28} $ More recent work on search and exchange assumes trading is anonymous so that credit is precluded-you will not accept an IOU from a trading partner if you would be unable to identify or locate that person when you wish to collect. $ ^{29} $ However, whether an agent will accept money in exchange for goods will depend on the probability the agent places on being able later to exchange money for a consumption good.

Suppose agents are endowed with a new good according to a Poisson process with arrival rate $ a .^{30} $ Trading opportunities arrive at rate $ b . $ A successful trade can occur if there is a double coincidence of wants. If $ x $ is the probability that another agent chosen at random is willing to accept the trader's commodity, the probability of a double coincidence of wants is $ x^{2} . $ A successful trade can also take place if there is a single coincidence of wants (i.e., one of the agents has a good the other wants), if one agent has money and the other agent is willing to accept it. That is, a trade can take place when an $ i j $ agent meets a $ j k $ agent if the $ i j $ agent has money and the $ j k $ agent is willing to accept it.

In this simple framework, agents can be in one of three states; an agent can be waiting for a new endowment to arrive (state 0 ), have a good to trade and be waiting to find a trading partner (state 1$ ) $, or have money and be waiting for a trading opportunity (state $ m $ ).

Three equilibria are possible. Suppose the probability of making a trade holding money is less than the probability of making a trade holding a commodity. In this case, individuals will prefer to hold on to their good when they meet another trader (absent a double coincidence) rather than trade for money. With no one willing to trade for money, money will be valueless in equilibrium. A second equilibrium arises when holding money makes a successful trade more likely than continuing to hold a commodity. So every agent will be willing to hold money, and in equilibrium all agents will be willing to accept money in exchange for goods. A mixed monetary equilibrium can also exist; agents accept money with some probability as long as they believe other agents will accept it with the same probability.

The Kiyotaki-Wright model emphasized the exchange process and the possibility for an intrinsically valueless money to be accepted in trade. It did so, however, by assuming a fixed rate of exchange-one unit of money is exchanged for one unit of goods whenever a trade takes place. The value of money in terms of goods is either 0 (in a nonmonetary equilibrium) or $ 1 . $ In the subsequent literature, however, the goods price of money is determined endogenously as part of the equilibrium. For example, in Trejos and Wright (1995), this price is the outcome of a bargaining process between buyers and sellers who meet through a process similar to that in Kiyotaki and Wright. However, Trejos and Wright assumed money is indivisible, whereas goods are infinitely divisible (i.e., all trades involve one dollar, but the quantity of goods exchanged for that dollar may vary). Shi (1997) extended the KiyotakiWright search model to include divisible goods and divisible money, and Shi (1999) also analyzed inflation and its effects on growth in a search model.

Lagos and Wright (2005) and Rocheteau and Wright (2005) are good examples of search models and the insights about the costs of inflation that this literature has provided. Money is perfectly divisible and is the only storable good available to agents. Assume each period is divided into subperiods, called day and night. Agents consume and supply labor (produce) in both subperiods. The subperiods differ in terms of their market structure. Night markets are centralized and competitive; day markets are decentralized and prices (and quantities) are set via bargaining between individual agents in bilateral meetings.

The preferences of agents are identical and given by
$$
 U=U(x, h, X, H)=u(x)-c(h)+U(X)-H
$$
where $ x(X) $ is consumption during the day (night), and $ h(H) $ is labor supply during the day (night). The utility functions $ u, c $, and $ U $ have standard properties, and it is assumed that there exist $ q^{*} $ and $ X^{*} $ such that $ u^{\prime}\left(q^{*}\right)=c^{\prime}\left(q^{*}\right) $ and $ U^{\prime}\left(X^{*}\right)=1 . $ Utility is linear in night labor supply $ H . $ The technology allows one unit of $ H $ to be transformed into one unit of $ X $. Hence $ X^{*} $ is the quantity of the night good such that marginal utility equals marginal cost.

During the night, trading takes place in a centralized Walrasian market. Consider the decision problem of an agent who enters the night market with nominal money balances $ m . $ Let $ \phi_{t} $ denote the price of money in terms of goods (i.e., the price level, the price of goods in terms of money, is $ \left.1 / \phi_{t}\right) . $ Let $ W_{t}(m) $ be the value function for an agent at the start of the night market with money holds $ m $. Let $ V_{t+1}\left(m^{\prime}\right) $ be the value function for the agent entering the day market (described later). Then the agent will choose $ X, H $, and $ m^{\prime} $ to maximize
$$
 U(X)-H+\beta V_{t+1}\left(m^{\prime}\right) 
$$
subject to a budget constraint of the form
$$
 \phi_{t} m+H=X+\phi_{t} m^{\prime} 
$$
The left side of this equation represents the agent's real money holdings on entering the night market plus income generated from production. The right side is consumption plus real balances carried into the next day market. Using the budget constraint, the problem can be rewritten as
$$
 W_{t}(m)=\max _{X, m^{\prime}}\left[U(X)+\phi_{t} m-X+\phi_{t} m^{\prime}+\beta V_{t+1}\left(m^{\prime}\right)\right] \tag{3.53}
$$
The first-order conditions for an interior solution take the form $ ^{31} $
$$
 U^{\prime}(X)=1 \Rightarrow X=X^{*} \tag{3.54}
$$
and
$$
 \phi_{t}+\beta V_{t+1}^{\prime}\left(m^{\prime}\right)=0 \tag{3.55}
$$
Equations $ (3.54) $ and $ (3.55) $ imply that $ X $ and $ m^{\prime} $ are independent of $ m . $ This is a consequence of the assumption that utility is linear in $ H . $ Intuitively, the marginal value of accumulating an extra dollar in the centralized market is $ \beta V_{t+1}^{\prime}\left(m_{t+1}^{\prime}\right) . $ The marginal cost of acquiring an extra dollar is $ \phi_{t} $ times the utility cost of the extra labor needed to produce and sell more output. But the marginal disutility of work is a constant (equal to 1$ ) . $ So the marginal costs of acquiring an extra dollar is just $ \phi_{t} $, which is the same for all agents. But if all agents exit the night market holding the same level of money balances, i.e, the same $ m^{\prime} $, the distribution of money holdings across agents at the start of each day will be degenerate. This is extremely useful in dealing with a model in which agents may have different market experiences, as they will in Lagos and Wright's day market, while still preserving the idea of a representative agent. Shi (1999) adopted the notion of a large family whose individual members may have different experiences during each period but who reunite into a representative family at the end of each period. This approach, originally introduced by Lucas
(1990), is used in chapter 5 when discussing models that impose restrictions on access by some agents to credit markets.

A final result from (3.53) that will be useful is that $ W $ can be written as
$$
 W_{t}(m)=\phi_{t} m+\max _{X, m^{\prime}}\left[U(X)-X+\phi_{t} m^{\prime}+\beta V_{t+1}\left(m^{\prime}\right)\right] 
$$
showing that $ W $ is linear in $ m $. The subperiods differ in the nature of the trading process that occurs in each. The day good $ x $ comes in different varieties, and each agent consumes a different variety than the one he produces. Hence, there is a motive for trade. As in the night market, one unit of labor can be converted into one unit of the good. In the day market, agents search for trading partners. With probability $ \alpha $, they meet another agent. One of three possible outcomes can occur as a result of this meeting. First, each consumes what the other produces. This corresponds to a double coincidence of wants; no money or credit is necessary for a trade to occur. Assume the probability of a double coincidence of wants is $ \delta . $ Second, there could be a single coincidence of wants; one agent consumes what the other produces, but not vice versa. Assume the probability of this occurring is $ 2 \sigma .^{32} $ Finally, neither agent consumes what the other produces, an event that occurs with probability $ 1-\delta-2 \sigma $.

Recall that $ V_{t}(m) $ is the value function for an agent with money holdings $ m $ who is entering the decentralized day market, and $ W_{t}(m) $ is the value function when entering the centralized night market. Let $ F_{t}(\tilde{m}) $ be the fraction of agents at the beginning of day $ t $ with $ m \leq \tilde{m} $. Then
$$
\begin{align}
V_{t}(m)=& \alpha \delta \int B_{t}(m, \tilde{m}) d F_{t}(\tilde{m}) \\
&+\alpha \sigma \int\left\{u\left[q_{t}(m, \tilde{m})\right]+W_{t}\left[m-d_{t}(m, \tilde{m})\right]\right\} d F_{t}(\tilde{m}) \\
&+\alpha \sigma \int\left\{-c\left[q_{t}(\tilde{m}, m)\right]+W_{t}\left[m+d_{t}(\tilde{m}, m)\right]\right\} d F_{t}(\tilde{m}) \\
&+(1-\alpha \delta-2 \alpha \sigma) W_{t}(m), \tag{3.56}
\end{align}
$$
where $ B_{t}(m, \tilde{m}) $ is the payoff to an agent holding $ m $ who meets an agent holding $ \tilde{m} $ when there is a double coincidence of wants. The four terms in $ V_{t}(m) $ are (1) the probability of a double coincidence times the expected payoff; (2) the probability the agent meets another agent with $ \tilde{m} $, there is a single coincidence of want, and $ d_{t}(m, \tilde{m}) $ is exchanged for $ q_{t}(m, \tilde{m}) $ of the consumption good; (3) the probability of a single coincidence meeting in which the agent produces $ q_{t}(\tilde{m}, m) $ and receives $ d_{t}(\tilde{m}, m) ; $ and
(4) the probability that no meeting (or trade) occurs and the agent enters the night market with $ m $.

Because the day meetings each involve just two agents, the search literature has generally assumed the price and quantity exchanged, $ q_{t} $ and $ d_{t} $, are determined by Nash bargaining between the agents. When a double coincidence of wants occurs, the joint surplus is maximized when $ q^{*} $ is exchanged, where
$$
 u^{\prime}\left(q^{*}\right)=c^{\prime}\left(q^{*}\right) 
$$
Hence, $ B_{t}(m, \tilde{m})=u\left(q^{*}\right)-c\left(q^{*}\right)+W_{t}(m) $.
When a single coincidence occurs, bargaining is more complicated. Let the buyer's share of the joint surplus from a bargain be $ \theta \in[0 \quad 1] . $ The threat point of a buyer is $ W_{t}(m) ; $ that of the seller is $ W_{t}(\tilde{m}) $, where $ m $ and $ \tilde{m} $ are the buyer's and the seller's initial money holdings. The exchange of $ q $ for $ d $ units of money maximizes
$$
 \left[u(q)+W_{t}(m-d)-W_{t}(m)\right]^{\theta}\left[-c(q)+W_{t}(m+d)-W_{t}(m)\right]^{1-\theta} \tag{3.57}
$$
subject to $ d \geq 0, q \geq 0 . $ Recall that $ W_{t}(m) $ is linear in $ m . $ Hence, $ (3.57) $ can be rewritten as
$$
 \left[u(q)-\phi_{t} d\right]^{\theta}\left[-c(q)+\phi_{t} d\right]^{1-\theta} \tag{3.58}
$$
If $ d \leq m $, money holdings are not a binding constraint, and the first-order conditions with respect to $ d $ and $ q $ yield
$$
\begin{aligned}
-\theta \phi_{t}\left[u(q)-\phi_{t} d\right]^{-1}+(1-\theta) \phi_{t}\left[-c(q)+\phi_{t} d\right]=0 \\
 \theta u^{\prime}(q)\left[u(q)-\phi_{t} d\right]^{-1}-(1-\theta) c^{\prime}(q)\left[-c(q)+\phi_{t} d\right]=0 
\end{aligned}
$$
Or
$$
\begin{aligned}
u^{\prime}(q)=c^{\prime}(q) \Rightarrow q_{t}=q^{*} \\
 \phi_{t} d^{*}=\theta c\left(q^{*}\right)+(1-\theta) u\left(q^{*}\right) 
\end{aligned}
$$
The monetary cost of $ q, d^{*} $, is a weighted average of the cost of producing it and the value of consuming it, with weights reflecting the bargaining power of the buyer and seller.

If $ d^{*}>m $, then the buyer does not have the cash necessary to purchase $ q^{*} ; $ in effect, the cash-in-advance constraint is binding. In this case, Lagos and Wright $ (2005) $ showed, the seller receives all the buyer's money, so
$$
 \phi_{t} d_{t}=\phi_{t} m=z\left(q_{t}\right) \tag{3.59}
$$
where $ q_{t} $ is the solution to the constrained Nash bargaining problem. $ ^{33} $ The quantity transacted and the price depend on the buyer's money holdings but do not depend on the seller's; this quantity can be expressed as a function of $ m: q_{t}=q_{t}(m) $.

Lagos and Wright showed that $ m^{\prime} $, the amount of money agents carry out of the night market is less than $ d^{*} $ whenever the inflation rate, $ \left(\phi_{t} / \phi_{t+1}\right)-1 $, exceeds $ \beta-1 $. Recall that an inflation rate of $ \beta-1 $ corresponds to the Friedman rule of a zero nominal interest rate. So, just as in the earlier CIA models, the cash-in-advance constraint is binding when the nominal rate of interest is positive. Of course, the constraint only binds for agents who find buyers in single coincidence of wants meetings. Sellers, or those in a double coincidence of wants meeting or in no meeting, exit the period with unchanged money holdings.

Now consider the value to an agent of entering the day market with money holdings $ m . $ This value arises from the effects of $ m $ on price and quantity when the agent is the buyer in a single coincidence of wants meeting. Since the probability that this occurs is $ \alpha \sigma $, it can be expressed, using $ (3.56) $, as
$$
 v_{t}(m)=\alpha \sigma \int\left\{u\left[q_{t}(m)\right]-\phi_{t} d_{t}(m)\right\} d F_{t}(\tilde{m}) 
$$
The value of money is then given by the pricing equation
$$
 \phi_{t}=\beta\left[v_{t+1}^{\prime}(M)+\phi_{t+1}\right]  \tag{3.60}
$$
where $ M $ is the aggregate nominal quantity of money. Because $ d_{t+1}^{\prime}(M)=1( $ an increase in the quantity of money increases the number of dollars needed to purchase goods by the same amount),
$$
 v_{t+1}^{\prime}(M)=\alpha \sigma\left[u^{\prime}\left[q_{t+1}(M)\right] q_{t+1}^{\prime}(M)-\phi_{t+1}\right] 
$$
Using this in $ (3.60) $
$$
 \phi_{t}=\beta \alpha \sigma u^{\prime}\left[q_{t+1}\right] q_{t+1}^{\prime}(M)+\beta(1-\alpha \sigma) \phi_{t+1} \tag{3.61}
$$
The value of money is determined by the marginal utility of the goods the agent is able to consume when faced with a single coincidence of wants trading opportunity. If such meetings are uncommon $ (\alpha \sigma $ is small $ ) $, money will be less useful and therefore less valuable. This implication of search models of money emphasizes the importance of the trading environment for determining the value of money. Equation $ (3.61) $ can be rewritten, using $ (3.59), \mathrm{as}^{34} $
$$
 \phi_{t}=\beta\left[\alpha \sigma \frac{u^{\prime}\left(q_{t+1}\right)}{z^{\prime}\left(q_{t+1}\right)}+(1-\alpha \sigma)\right] \phi_{t+1} 
$$
Now consider a steady state in which the money stock grows at the rate $ \tau . $ The inflation rate will also equal $ \tau:\left(\phi_{t} / \phi_{t+1}\right)-1=\tau $. Thus,
$$
 \phi_{t}=\beta\left[\alpha \sigma \frac{u^{\prime}\left(q_{t+1}\right)}{z^{\prime}\left(q_{t+1}\right)}+(1-\alpha \sigma)\right] \phi_{t+1} \Rightarrow 1=\beta\left[\alpha \sigma \frac{u^{\prime}(q)}{z^{\prime}(q)}+(1-\alpha \sigma)\right]\left(\frac{1}{1+\tau}\right) 
$$
using $ (3.59) . $ Solving for $ u^{\prime} / z^{\prime} $,
$$
 \frac{u^{\prime}(q)}{z^{\prime}(q)}=\frac{1+\tau-\beta(1-\alpha \sigma)}{\beta \alpha \sigma}=1+\frac{1+\tau-\beta}{\beta \alpha \sigma} 
$$
The left side of this equation, $ u^{\prime} / z^{\prime} $, is the marginal utility of consumption divided by the marginal cost of the good. The right side is 1 plus a term that can be written as $ \beta^{-1}(1+\tau)-1 $ divided by $ \alpha \sigma . $ But since $ \beta^{-1} $ is the gross real interest rate, and $ \tau $ is the inflation rate, $ \beta^{-1}(1+\tau)-1 $ is the nominal rate of interest, so
$$
 \frac{u^{\prime}(q)}{z^{\prime}(q)}=1+\frac{i}{\alpha \sigma} \tag{3.62}
$$
This looks very similar to earlier results from a CIA model (see (3.33)). A positive nominal interest rate acts as a tax on consumption. But this tax now also depends on the nature of trading. An increase in the frequency of single coincidence of wants meetings, by raising the usefulness of money, reduces the net cost of holding money. 

While it is clear that the tax is zero if the Friedman rule of a zero nominal interest rate is followed, Lagos and Wright showed that the equilibrium with $ i=0 $ is still not fully efficient because of the trading frictions associated with bargaining in the decentralized market. Efficiency requires that all the surplus go to the buyer $ (\theta=1) .^{35} $ In standard models such as the MIU model in chapter 2, or the CIA model developed in section $ 3.3 $, full efficiency is attained with $ i=0 . $ Then, since $ i=0 $ maximizes welfare, small deviations have small effects on welfare (basically an application of the envelope theorem). But if $ \theta<1 $, the equilibrium with $ i=0 $ in the search model does not fully maximize utility. Hence, small deviations from the Friedman rule can have firstorder effects on welfare. By calibrating their model, Lagos and Wright found much larger welfare costs of positive nominal interest rates than other authors had found. 

The importance of the trading environment in determining the costs of inflation was further explored by Rocheteau and Wright (2005). They compared welfare costs in three settings: a search model similar to Lagos and Wright $ (2005) $, a competitive market model, and a search model with posted prices (rather than the bilateral bargaining of the basic search model). By allowing for endogenous determination of the number of market participants, Rocheteau and Wright introduced an extensive margin (the effects on the value of money as the number of traders varies) as well as an intensive margin (the effects for a given number of traders as individual agent's money holdings vary). The Friedman rule always ensures efficiency along the intensive margin, but the extensive margin may still generate a source of inefficiency. Interestingly, if the market makers in the competitive search version of the model internalize the effects of the prices they post on the number of traders they attract, the model endogenously ensures that the Hosios condition is satisfied and the equilibrium is fully efficient when the nominal rate of interest is zero. Lagos and Rocheteau (2005) explored the interactions of the pricing mechanism (bilateral bargaining versus posted pricing) and found that with directed search, inflation can increase search intensities when inflation is low but reduce them when inflation is high. Thus, at low inflation rates, an increase in inflation can raise output, but they showed that this actually reduces welfare and that the Friedman rule supports the efficient equilibrium.

The Lagos and Wright model has only one nominal asset-money. If an interestbearing nominal asset such as a bond were introduced into the analysis, it would dominate money whenever the nominal interest rate is positive. To explain the simultaneous existence of interest-bearing nominal bonds and non-interest-bearing money, Shi (2005) employed a model with a decentralized goods market and a centralized bond market but in which there are assumed to be barriers to trading across markets. Households can use either bonds or money in the goods market, but only money can be used to purchase bonds. At the start of each period, the household must allocate its money holdings between the two markets. Assume a fraction $ a $ is sent to the goods market and $ 1-a $ to the bond market. Let $ \omega_{t}^{m} $ denote the value of money at the end of period $ t . $ Then Shi showed that
$$
 \omega_{t}^{m}=\beta a \alpha \sigma \lambda_{t+1}^{m}+\beta \omega_{t+1}^{m} 
$$
where $ \beta $ is the discount factor, $ \alpha $ and $ \sigma $ are the probability of meeting a potential trading partner and the probability that there is single coincidence of wants, and $ \lambda^{m} $ is the Lagrangian multiplier on the constraint that the money payment from buyer to seller in the goods market must be less than the buyer's money holdings. Thus, $ a \alpha \sigma \lambda_{t+1}^{m} $ is the service value of money in facilitating a goods purchase. The current value of money is equal to this service value plus the discounted future value of money.

Money that the household sends to the bond market cannot be used to purchase current goods, nor can the newly purchased bonds be used to exchange for goods. While bonds can, in future periods, be used to purchase goods, purchasing bonds initially entails a one-period loss of liquidity. Therefore, bonds must sell at a discount relative to money; if $ S $ is the money price of a bond, $ S<1 . $ Shi demonstrated that the nominal interest rate, $ (1-S) / S $, is given by
$$
 \frac{1-S}{S}=\frac{a \alpha \sigma \lambda^{m}}{\omega^{m}} \tag{3.63}
$$
which is positive if $ \lambda^{m} $ is positive. This expression for the nominal interest rate can be compared to (3.32) obtained in a basic cash-in-advance model. Similar to the result in other models in the search literature, $ (3.63) $ reveals how the nature of transactions in the decentralized market as reflected in the parameters $ \alpha $ and $ \sigma $ affect the value of money and the nominal interest rate.

In Shi's basic model, old bonds and money can both circulate in the goods market and be used in purchasing goods. Suppose, however, that the government also engages as a seller in the goods market, and assume the government only accepts money in payment for goods. Since there is a chance a household will encounter a government seller in the decentralized market, and frictions are assumed to prevent the household from locating another seller, there is a smaller probability of a successful trade if the household carries only bonds into the goods market than if it carries money. This difference drives bonds out of the goods market, and Shi showed that only money circulates as a means of payment.

The search-theoretic approach to monetary economics provides a natural framework for addressing a number of issues. Ritter (1995) used it to examine the conditions necessary for fiat money to arise, linking it to the credibility of the issuer. Governments lacking credibility would be expected to overissue the currency to gain seigniorage. In this case, agents would be unwilling to hold the fiat money. Soller and Waller (2000) used a search-theoretic approach to study the coexistence of legal and illegal currencies. By stressing the role of money in facilitating exchange, the searchtheoretic approach emphasizes the role of money as a medium of exchange. The approach also emphasizes the social aspect of valued money; agents are willing to accept fiat money only in environments in which they expect others to accept such money. $ ^{36} $

## 3.5 Summary

The models studied in this chapter are among the basic frameworks monetary economists have found useful for understanding the steady-state implications of inflation and the steady-state welfare implications of alternative rates of inflation. These models and those of chapter 2 assume prices are perfectly flexible, adjusting to ensure that market equilibrium is continuously maintained. The MIU, CIA, shopping-time, and search models all represent means of introducing valued money into a general equilibrium framework. Each approach captures some aspects of the role that money plays in facilitating transactions.

Despite the different approaches, several conclusions are common to all. First, because the price level is completely flexible, the value of money, equal to 1 over the price of goods, behaves like an asset price. $ { }^{37} $ The return money yields, however, differs in the various approaches. 

- In the MIU model, the marginal utility of money is the direct return, 
- whereas in the CIA model, this return is measured by the Lagrangian multiplier on the CIA constraint. 
- In the shopping-time model, the return arises from the time savings provided by money in carrying out transactions, and the value of this time savings depends on the real wage. 
- In search models it depends on the probability of trading opportunities.

All these models have similar implications for the optimal rate of inflation. An efficient equilibrium will be characterized by equality between social and private costs. Because the social cost of producing money is taken to be zero, the private opportunity cost of holding money must be zero in order to achieve optimality. The private opportunity cost is measured by the nominal interest rate, so the optimal rate of inflation in the steady state is the rate that achieves a zero nominal rate of interest. While this result is quite general, two important considerations - the effects of inflation on government revenues and the interaction of inflation with other taxes in a nonindexed tax systemâ€”have been ignored. These are among the topics of chapter 4.

## Question

n = 0?
$$
f\left(k_{t-1}, n_{t}\right)+\tau_{t}+(1-\delta) k_{t-1}+\frac{\left(1+i_{t-1}\right) b_{t-1}+m_{t-1}}{1+\pi_{t}}=c_{t}+k_{t}+b_{t}+m_{t}
$$
Typo? beta

where $ i_{t} $ is the nominal rate of interest and, using (3.7) and (3.8),
$$
\frac{V_{a}\left(a_{t+1}, k_{t}\right)}{V_{a}\left(a_{t}, k_{t-1}\right)}=\frac{1+\pi_{t+1}}{1+i_{t}}
$$
