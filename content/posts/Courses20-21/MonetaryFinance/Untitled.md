n is labor time, $n^s$ is shopping-time

$$
n^{s}=g(c, m), \quad g_{c}>0, g_{m} \leq 0
$$

when money is enough
$$
\lim _{m \rightarrow \bar{m}} g_{m}=0
$$

g() is marginal utility of shopping-time 

$ \psi=\psi\left(m, n^{s}\right)=c $
where $ \psi_{m} \geq 0, \psi_{n^{s}} \geq 0 $ and $ \psi_{m m} \leq 0, \psi_{n^{s} n^{s}} \leq 0 $



Wang and Yip (1992) characterized the situation in which these two dominate, so that ucmb0 as the transaction services version of the MIU model.

With ucm < 0, a monetary injection that raises expected inflation
will increase consumption, labor supply, and output. (替代效应)

The marginal utility of consumption is set equal to the marginal utility of wealth, $ V_{a}\left(a_{t}, k_{t-1}\right), $ plus the cost, in utility units, of the marginal time needed to purchase consumption. Thus, the total cost of consumption includes the value of the shopping time involved. A marginal increase in consumption requires an additional $ g_{c} $ in shopping time. The value of this time in terms of goods is obtained by multiplying $ g_{c} $ by the real wage $ w, $ and its value in terms of utility is $ V_{a}(a, k) w g_{c} $.

In chapter 2, i = 0 is the optimal inflation rate

In chapter 3, i = 0 need $g_m = 0$ mean that money is enough to make
