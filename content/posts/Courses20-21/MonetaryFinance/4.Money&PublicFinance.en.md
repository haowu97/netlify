## 4.1 Introduction

**Inflation is a tax**. And as a tax, it both generates revenue for the government and distorts private sector behavior. Chapters 2 and 3 focused on these distortions. In the Sidrauski model, inflation distorts the demand for money, thereby generating welfare effects because real money holdings directly yield utility. In the cash-in-advance model, inflation serves as an implicit tax on consumption, so a higher inflation rate generates a substitution toward leisure, leading to lower labor supply, output and consumption.

In the analysis of these distortions, the revenue side of the inflation tax was ignored except to note that the Friedman rule for the optimal rate of inflation may need to be modified if the government does not have lump-sum sources of revenue available. Any change in inflation that affects the revenue from the inflation tax will have budgetary implications for the government. If higher **inflation allows other forms of distortionary taxation to be reduced**, this fact must be incorporated into any assessment of the costs of the inflation tax. This chapter introduces the government sectors budget constraint and examines the revenue implications of inflation. This allows a more explicit focus on the role of inflation in a theory of public finance and draws on the literature on optimal taxation to analyze the effects of inflation.

A public finance approach yields several insights. Among the most important is the recognition that fiscal and monetary policies are linked through the government sectors budget constraint. **Variations in the inflation rate can have implications for the fiscal authority's decisions about expenditures and taxes,** and, conversely, decisions by the fiscal authority can have implications for money growth and inflation. When inflation is viewed as a distortionary revenue-generating tax, the degree to which it should be relied upon depends on the set of alternative taxes available to the government and on the reasons individuals hold money.

In the next section. the consolidated governments budget identity is set out, and some of the revenue implications of inflation are examined. Section 4.3 introduces various assumptions that can be made about the relationship between monetary and fiscal policies. Section 4.4 discusses situations of fiscal dominance in which a fixed amount of revenue must be raised from the inflation tax. It then discusses the equilibrium relationship between money and the price level. Section 4.5 turns to recent theories that emphasize what has come to be called the fiscal theory of the price level. In section 4.6, inflation revenue (seigniorage) and other taxes are brought together to analyze the joint determination of the governments tax instruments. This theme is developed first in a partial equilibrium model, and then Friedmans rule for the optimal inflation rate is revisited. The implications of optimal Ramsey taxation for inflation are discussed. Finally, section 4.6.4 contains a brief discussion of some additional effects that arise when the tax system is not fully indexed.

## 4.2 Budget Accounting

To understand the revenue implications of inflation (and the inflation implications of the government's revenue needs), one must start with the government's *budget constraint*. Consider the following **identity** for the fiscal branch of a government:
$$
\underbrace{G_{t}+i_{t-1} B_{t-1}^{T}}_{Expenditure}=\underbrace{T_{t}+\left(B_{t}^{T}-B_{t-1}^{T}\right)+\mathrm{RCB}_{t}}_{Income} \tag{4.1}
$$
where all variables are in nominal terms. The left side consists of government expenditures on goods, services, and transfers $ G_{t}, $ plus interest payments on the outstanding debt $ i_{t-1} B_{t-1}^{T} $ (the superscript $ T $ denoting total debt, assumed to be one period in maturity, where debt issued in period $ t-1 $ earns the nominal interest rate $ \left.i_{t-1}\right), $ and the right side consists of tax revenue $ T_{t}, $ plus new issues of interest-bearing debt $ B_{t}^{T}-B_{t-1}^{T}, $ plus any *direct receipts from the central bank* $ \mathrm{RCB}_{t} . $ As an example of $ \mathrm{RCB}, $ the U.S. Federal Reserve turns over to the Treasury almost all the interest earnings on its portfolio of government debt. Equation (4.1) is referred to as the **Treasury's budget constraint**.

The **monetary authority**, or central bank, also has a **budget identity** that links changes in its assets and liabilities. This takes the form
$$
\left(B_{t}^{M}-B_{t-1}^{M}\right)+\mathrm{RCB}_{t}=i_{t-1} B_{t-1}^{M}+\left(H_{t}-H_{t-1}\right) \tag{4.2}
$$
where $ B_{t}^{M}-B_{t-1}^{M} $ is equal to the central bank's purchases of government debt, $ i_{t-1} B_{t-1}^{M} $ is the central bank's receipt of interest payments from the Treasury, and $ H_{t}-H_{t-1} $ is *the change in the central bank's own liabilities.* These liabilities are called *high-powered money*, or sometimes the *monetary base*, because they form the stock of currency held by the *nonbank public plus bank reserves*, and they represent the reserves private banks can use to back deposits. 

By letting $ B=B^{T}-B^{M} $ be the stock of government interest-bearing debt held by the public, the budget identities of the Treasury and the central bank can be combined to produce the consolidated government sector budget identity:
$$
G_{t}+i_{t-1} B_{t-1}=T_{t}+\left(B_{t}-B_{t-1}\right)+\left(H_{t}-H_{t-1}\right) \tag{4.3}
$$
From the perspective of the consolidated government sector, only debt held by the public (i.e., outside the government sector) represents an interest-bearing liability. According to (4.3), the dollar value of government purchases $ G_{t}, $ plus its payment of interest on outstanding privately held debt $ i_{t-1} B_{t-1}, $ must be funded by revenue that can be obtained from one of three alternative sources. 

1. First, $ T_{t} $ represents revenues generated by taxes (other than inflation). 
2. Second, the government can obtain funds by borrowing from the private sector. This borrowing is equal to the change in the debt held by the private sector, $ B_{t}-B_{t-1} . $ 
3. Finally, the government can print currency to pay for its expenditures, and this is represented by the change in the outstanding stock of non-interest-bearing debt, $ H_{t}-H_{t-1} $. 

Equation (4.3) can be divided by the price level $ P_{t} $ to obtain
$$
 \frac{G_{t}}{P_{t}}+i_{t-1}\left(\frac{B_{t-1}}{P_{t}}\right)=\frac{T_{t}}{P_{t}}+\frac{B_{t}-B_{t-1}}{P_{t}}+\frac{H_{t}-H_{t-1}}{P_{t}} \tag{4.4}
$$
Note that terms like $ B_{t-1} / P_{t} $ can be multiplied and divided by $ P_{t-1}, $ yielding
$$
 \frac{B_{t-1}}{P_{t}}=\left(\frac{B_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}\right)\left(\frac{P_{t-1}}{P_{t}}\right)=b_{t-1}\left(\frac{1}{1+\pi_{t}}\right) 
$$
where $ b_{t-1}=B_{t-1} / P_{t-1} $ represents real debt and $ \pi_{t} $ is the inflation rate. With the convention that lowercase letters denote variables deflated by the price level, the government's budget identity is
$$
g_{t}+\bar{r}_{t-1} b_{t-1}=t_{t}+\left(b_{t}-b_{t-1}\right)+h_{t}-\frac{h_{t-1}}{\left(1+\pi_{t}\right)} \tag{4.4}
$$
where $ \bar{r}_{t-1}=\left[\left(1+i_{t-1}\right) /\left(1+\pi_{t}\right)\right]-1 $ is the ex post real return from $ t-1 $ to $ t $. 

To highlight the respective roles of anticipated and unanticipated inflation, let $ r_{t} $ be the *ex ante real rate of return* and let $ \pi_{t}^{e} $ be the expected rate of inflation; then $ 1+i_{t-1}=\left(1+r_{t-1}\right)\left(1+\pi_{t}^{e}\right) $. 

Adding $ \left(r_{t-1}-\bar{r}_{t-1}\right) b_{t-1}=\left(\pi_{t}-\pi_{t}^{e}\right)\left(1+r_{t-1}\right) b_{t-1} /  \left(1+\pi_{t}\right) $ to both sides of (4.4), and rearranging, the budget constraint becomes
$$
g_{t}+r_{t-1} b_{t-1}=t_{t}+\left(b_{t}-b_{t-1}\right)+\left(\frac{\pi_{t}-\pi_{t}^{e}}{1+\pi_{t}}\right)\left(1+r_{t-1}\right) b_{t-1}+\left[h_{t}-\left(\frac{1}{1+\pi_{t}}\right) h_{t-1}\right] \tag{4.5}
$$
The third term on the right side of this expression, involving $ \left(\pi_{t}-\pi_{t}^{e}\right) b_{t-1}, $ **represents the revenue generated when unanticipated inflation reduces the real value of the government's outstanding interest-bearing nominal debt**. To the extent that inflation is anticipated, this term will be zero; $ \pi_{t}^{e} $ will be reflected in the nominal interest rate that the government must pay. **Inflation by itself does not reduce the burden of the government's interest-bearing debt; only unexpected inflation has such an effect**.

### 4.2.1 Seigniorage

The last bracketed term in (4.5) represents seigniorage, the revenue from money creation. *Seigniorage* can be written as
$$
 s_{t} \equiv \frac{H_{t}-H_{t-1}}{P_{t}}=\left(h_{t}-h_{t-1}\right)+\left(\frac{\pi_{t}}{1+\pi_{t}}\right) h_{t-1} \tag{4.6}
$$
**Seigniorage arises from two sources**:

- First, $ h_{t}-h_{t-1} $ is equal to the change in real high-powered money holdings. Since the government is the monopoly issuer of high-powered money, an increase in the amount of high-powered money that the private sector is willing to hold allows the government to obtain real resources in return. In a steady-state equilibrium, $ h $ is constant, so this source of seigniorage then equals zero.
- The second term in (4.6) is normally the focus of analyses of seigniorage because it can be nonzero even in the steady state. To maintain a constant level of real money holdings, the private sector needs to increase its nominal holdings of money at the rate $ \pi $ (approximately) to offset the effects of inflation on real holdings. By supplying money to meet this demand, the government is able to obtain goods and services or reduce other taxes.

Denote the growth rate of the nominal monetary base $ H $ by $ \theta ; $ the growth rate of $ h $ will equal $ (\theta-\pi) /(1+\pi) \approx \theta-\pi $. In a steady state, $ h $ will be constant, implying that $ \pi=\theta $. In this case, (4.6) shows that seigniorage will equal
$$
\left(\frac{\pi}{1+\pi}\right) h=\left(\frac{\theta}{1+\theta}\right) h . \tag{4.7}
$$
For small values of the rate of inflation, $ \pi /(1+\pi) $ is approximately equal to $ \pi, $ so **seigniorage can be thought of as the product of a tax rate of $ \pi, $ the rate of inflation, and a tax base of $ h, $ the real stock of base money**. Since base money does not pay interest, its real value is depreciated by inflation whether or not inflation is anticipated.

The definition of $ s $ would appear to imply that the government receives no revenue if inflation is zero. But this inference neglects the real interest savings to the government of issuing $ h, $ which is non-interest-bearing debt, as opposed to $ b $, which is interest-bearing debt. That is, for a given level of the government's total real liabilities $ d=b+h $, interest costs will be a decreasing function of the fraction of this total that consists of $ h $. A shift from interest-bearing to non-interest-bearing debt would allow the government to reduce total tax revenues or increase transfers or purchases. 

This observation suggests that one should consider the government's budget constraint expressed in terms of the total liabilities of the government. Using (4.5) and (4.6), the budget constraint can be rewritten as
$$
g_{t}+r_{t-1} d_{t-1}=t_{t}+\left(d_{t}-d_{t-1}\right)+\left(\frac{\pi_{t}-\pi_{t}^{e}}{1+\pi_{t}}\right)\left(1+r_{t-1}\right) d_{t-1}+\left(\frac{i_{t-1}}{1+\pi_{t}}\right) h_{t-1} \tag{4.8}
$$
*Seigniorage*, defined as the last term in $ (4.8), $ becomes
$$
\bar{s}=\left(\frac{i}{1+\pi}\right) h \tag{4.9}
$$
This shows that the relevant tax rate on high-powered money depends directly on the nominal rate of interest. Thus, under the **Friedman rule for the optimal rate of inflation, which calls for setting the nominal rate of interest equal to zero (see chapters 2 and 3 ), the government collects no revenue from seigniorage**. The budget constraint also illustrates that any change in seigniorage requires an offsetting adjustment in the other components of $ (4.8) . $ **Reducing the nominal interest rate to zero implies that the lost revenue must be replaced by an increase in other taxes, real borrowing** that increases the government's net indebtedness, or reductions in expenditures.

The various forms of the government's budget identity suggest at least *three alternative measures of the revenue from money creation*. 

- First, the measure that might be viewed as appropriate from the perspective of the Treasury is simply $ \mathrm{RCB}, $ total transfers from the central bank to the Treasury (see 4.1$ ) . $ For the United States, R. King and Plosser (1985) reported that the real value of these transfers amounted to $ 0.02 \% $ of real GNP during the $ 1929-1952 $ period and $ 0.15 \% $ of real GNP in the $ 1952-1982 $ period. Under this definition, shifts in the ownership of government debt between the private sector and the central bank affect the measure of seigniorage even if high-powered money remains constant. That is, from (4.2), if the central bank used interest receipts to purchase debt, $ B^{M} $ would rise, RCB would fall, and the Treasury would, from $ (4.1), $ need to raise other taxes, reduce expenditures, or issue more debt. But this last option means that the Treasury could simply issue debt equal to the increase in the central bank's debt holdings, leaving private debt holdings, government expenditures, and other taxes unaffected. Thus, **changes in $ \mathrm{RCB} $ do not represent real changes in the Treasury's finances and are therefore not the appropriate measure of seigniorage**.
- A second possible measure of seigniorage is given by $ (4.6), $ the *real value of the change in high-powered money*. King and Plosser reported that $ s $ equaled 1.37 percent of real GNP during $ 1929-1952 $ but only 0.3 percent during $ 1952-1982 . $ This measure of seigniorage equals the revenue from money creation for a given path of interest-bearing government debt. That is, $ s $ equals the total expenditures that could be funded, holding constant other tax revenues and the total private sector holdings of interest-bearing government debt. While $ s, $ expressed as a fraction of GNP, was quite small during the postwar period in the United States, King and Plosser reported much higher values for other countries. For example, it was more than 6 percent of GNP in Argentina and over 2 percent in Italy.
- Finally, (4.9) provides a third definition of seigniorage as the nominal *interest savings* from issuing non-interest-bearing as opposed to interest-bearing debt. Using the four- to six-month commercial paper rate as a measure of the nominal interest rate, King and Plosser reported that this measure of seigniorage equaled 0.2 percent of U.S. GNP during $ 1929-1952 $ and 0.47 percent during $ 1952-1982 . $ This third definition equals the revenue from money creation for a given path of total (interest- and non-interest-bearing) government debt; it equals the total expenditures that could be funded, holding constant other tax revenues and the total private sector holdings of real government liabilities.

The difference between $ s $ and $ \bar{s} $ arises from alternative definitions of fiscal policy. To understand the effects of monetary policy, one normally wants to consider changes in monetary policy while holding fiscal policy constant. Suppose tax revenues $ t $ are simply treated as lump-sum taxes. Then one definition of fiscal policy would be in terms of a time series for government purchases and interest-bearing debt: $ \left\{g_{t+i}, b_{t+i}\right\}_{i=0}^{\infty} . $ Changes in $ s, $ together with the changes in $ t $ necessary to maintain $ \left\{g_{t+i}, b_{t+i}\right\}_{i=0}^{\infty} $ unchanged, would constitute monetary policy. Under this definition, monetary policy would change the total liabilities of the government (i.e., $ b+h) $. An open market purchase by the central bank would, ceteris paribus, lower the stock of interest-bearing debt held by the public. The Treasury would then need to issue additional interest-bearing debt to keep the $ b_{t+i} $ sequence unchanged. Total government liabilities would rise. Alternatively, under the definition $ \bar{s}, $ fiscal policy sets the path $ \left\{g_{t+i}, d_{t+i}\right\}_{i=0}^{\infty} $ and monetary policy determines the division of $ d $ between interest- and non-interest-bearing debt but not its total.

### 4.2.2 Intertemporal Budget Balance

The budget relationships derived in the previous section link the government's choices concerning expenditures, taxes, debt, and seigniorage at each point in time. However, unless there are restrictions on the government's ability to borrow or to raise revenue from seigniorage, (4.8) places no direct constraint on expenditure or tax choices. If governments, like individuals, are constrained in their ability to borrow, then this constraint limits the government's choices. To see exactly how it does so requires focusing on the intertemporal budget constraint of the government.

Ignoring the effect of surprise inflation, the single-period budget identity of the government given by (4.5) can be written as
$$
g_{t}+r_{t-1} b_{t-1}=t_{t}+\left(b_{t}-b_{t-1}\right)+s_{t} 
$$
Assuming the interest factor $ r $ is a constant (and is positive), this equation can be solved forward to obtain
$$
(1+r) b_{t-1}+\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{g_{t+i}}{(1+r)^{i}}=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{t_{t+i}}{(1+r)^{i}}+\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{s_{t+i}}{(1+r)^{i}}+\lim _{i \rightarrow \infty} \frac{b_{t+i}}{(1+r)^{i}} \tag{4.10}
$$
The government's expenditure and tax plans are said to satisfy the requirement of intertemporal budget balance (the no Ponzi condition) if the last term in (4.10) equals zero:
$$
 \lim _{i \rightarrow \infty} \frac{b_{t+i}}{(1+r)^{i}}=0 \tag{4.11}
$$
In this case, the right side of (4.10) becomes the present discounted value of all current and future tax and seigniorage revenues, and this is equal to the left side, which is the present discounted value of all current and future expenditures plus current outstanding debt (principal plus interest). In other words, **the government must plan to raise sufficient revenue, in present value terms, to repay its existing debt and finance its planned expenditures**. Defining the primary deficit as $ \Delta=g-t-s, $ intertemporal budget balance implies, from $ (4.10), $ that
$$
 (1+r) b_{t-1}=-\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{\Delta_{t+i}}{(1+r)^{i}} \tag{4.12}
$$
Thus, if the government has outstanding debt $ \left(b_{t-1}>0\right), $ the present value of future primary deficits must be negative (i.e., the government must run a primary surplus in present value). This surplus can be generated through adjustments in expenditures, taxes, or seigniorage.

**Is (4.12) a constraint on the government**? Must the government (the combined monetary and fiscal authorities) pick expenditures, taxes, and seigniorage to ensure that (4.12) holds for all possible values of the initial price level and interest rates? **Or is it an equilibrium condition that need only hold at the equilibrium price level and interest rate**? Buiter (2002) argued strongly that the intertemporal budget balance condition represents a constraint on government behavior, and this is the perspective generally adopted here. However, Sims (1994), Woodford (1995; 2001a), and Cochrane (1999) argued that (4.12) is an equilibrium condition; this alternative perspective is taken up in section 4.5.

## 4.3 Money and Fiscal Policy Frameworks

Most analyses of monetary phenomena and monetary policy assume, usually without statement, that variations in the stock of money matter but that how a variation occurs does not. The nominal money supply could change because of a shift from tax-financed government expenditures to seigniorage-financed expenditures. Or it could change as the result of an open market operation in which the central bank purchases interest-bearing debt, financing the purchase by an increase in noninterest-bearing debt, holding other taxes constant (see $ (4.2)) . $ Because these two means of increasing the money stock have differing implications for taxes and the stock of interest-bearing government debt, they may lead to different effects on prices and/or interest rates.

The government sector's budget constraint links monetary and fiscal policies in ways that can matter for determining how a change in the money stock affects the equilibrium price level. $ ^{7} $ The budget link also means that one needs to be precise about defining monetary policy as distinct from fiscal policy. An open market purchase increases the stock of money, but by reducing the interest-bearing government debt held by the public, it has implications for the future stream of taxes needed to finance the interest cost of the government's debt. **So an open market operation potentially has a fiscal side to it**, and this fact can lead to ambiguity in defining what one means by a change in monetary policy, holding fiscal policy constant.

Any regime in which either taxes and/or seigniorage always adjust to **ensure that the government's intertemporal budget constraint is satisfied** is called a *Ricardian regime* (Sargent 1982). There two kinds of Ricardian regime:

1. In most traditional monetary economics analyses, fiscal policy is assumed to adjust to ensure that the government's intertemporal budget is always in balance while monetary policy is free to set the nominal money stock or the nominal rate of interest. This situation is described as one of *monetary dominance*, or one in which fiscal policy is passive and monetary policy is active (Leeper 1991$ ) $. The models of chapters 2 and 3 implicitly fall into this category in that fiscal policy was ignored and monetary policy determined the price level.
2. A second policy regime is one in which the fiscal authority sets its expenditure and taxes without regard to any requirement of intertemporal budget balance. If the present discounted value of these taxes is not sufficient to finance expenditures (in present value terms), seigniorage must adjust to ensure that the government's intertemporal budget constraint is satisfied. This regime is one of *fiscal dominance* (or active fiscal policy) and passive monetary policy, as monetary policy must adjust to deliver the level of seigniorage required to balance the government's budget. **Prices and inflation are affected by changes in fiscal policy** because these fiscal changes, if they require a change in seigniorage, alter the current and/or future money supply. 

A final regime leads to what has become known as the fiscal theory of the price level (Sims 1994; Woodford 1995; 2001a; Cochrane 1999 ). In this regime, the government's intertemporal budget constraint may not be satisfied for arbitrary price levels. Following Woodford (1995), these regimes are described as non-Ricardian. The discussion of non-Ricardian regimes is postponed until section 4.5.

## 4.4 Deficits and Inflation

The intertemporal budget constraint implies that any government with a current outstanding debt must run, in present value terms, future surpluses. One way to generate a surplus is to increase revenues from seigniorage, and for that reason, economists have been interested in the implications of budget deficits for future money growth. Two questions have formed the focus of studies of deficits and inflation: 

1. Do fiscal deficits necessarily imply that inflation will eventually occur? 
2. If inflation is not a necessary consequence of deficits, is it in fact a historical consequence?

**The literature on the first question** has focused on the implications for inflation if the monetary authority must act to ensure that the government's intertemporal budget is balanced. This interpretation views fiscal policy as set independently, so that the monetary authority is forced to generate enough seigniorage to satisfy the intertemporal budget balance condition. From (4.12), the government's intertemporal budget constraint takes the form
$$
 b_{t-1}=-R^{-1} \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} R^{-i}\left(g_{t+i}-t_{t+i}-s_{t+i}\right) 
$$

where $ R=1+r $ is the gross real interest rate, $ g_{t}-t_{t}-s_{t} $ is the *primary deficit*, and $ s_{t} $ is real seigniorage revenue. Let $ s_{t}^{f} \equiv t_{t}-g_{t} $ be the *primary fiscal surplus* (i.e., tax revenues minus expenditures but excluding interest payments and seigniorage revenue). Then the government's budget constraint can be written as
$$
b_{t-1}=R^{-1} \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} R^{-i} s_{t+i}^{f}+R^{-1} \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} R^{-i} s_{t+i} \tag{4.13}
$$
The current real liabilities of the government must be financed, in present value terms, by either a fiscal primary surplus or seigniorage.

Given the real value of the government's liabilities $ b_{t-1}$,(4.13) illustrates what Sargent and Wallace (1981) described as "*unpleasant monetarist arithmetic'* in a regime of fiscal dominance:

1. If the present value of the fiscal primary surplus is reduced, the present value of seigniorage must rise to maintain $ (4.13) . $ 
2. Or, for a given present value of $ s^{f}, $ an attempt by the monetary authority to reduce inflation and seigniorage today must lead to higher inflation and seigniorage in the future because the present discounted value of seigniorage cannot be altered. 
3. The mechanism is straightforward; if current inflation tax revenues are lowered, the deficit grows and the stock of debt rises. This implies an increase in the present discounted value of future tax revenues, including revenues from seigniorage. If the fiscal authority does not adjust, the monetary authority will be forced eventually to produce higher inflation.

**The literature on the second question**--has inflation been a consequence of deficits historically?--has focused on estimating empirically the effects of deficits on money growth. Joines (1985) found money growth in the United States to be positively related to major war spending but not to nonwar deficits. Grier and Neiman (1987) summarized a number of earlier studies of the relationship between deficits and money growth (and other measures of monetary policy) in the United States. That the results are generally inconclusive is perhaps not surprising because the studies they review were all based on postwar but pre-1980 data. Thus, the samples covered periods in which there was relatively little deficit variation and in which much of the existing variation arose from the endogenous response of deficits to the business cycle as tax revenues varied procyclically. Grier and Neiman did find that the structural (high-employment) deficit is a determinant of money growth. This finding is consistent with that of $ \mathrm{R} $. King and Plosser (1985) , who reported that the fiscal deficit does help to predict future seigniorage for the United States. They interpreted this as mixed evidence for fiscal dominance.

Demopoulos, Katsimbris, and Miller (1987) provided evidence on debt accommodation for eight OECD countries. These authors estimated a variety of central bank reaction functions (regression equations with alternative policy instruments on the left-hand side) in which the government deficit is included as an explanatory variable. For the post-Bretton Woods period, they found a range of outcomes, from no accommodation by the Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank to significant accommodation by the Bank of Italy and the Nederlandse Bank.

One objection to this empirical literature is that simple regressions of money growth on deficits, or unrestricted VAR used to assess Granger causality (i.e., whether deficits contain any predictive information about future money growth), ignore information about the long-run behavior of taxes, debt, and seigniorage that is implied by intertemporal budget balance. **Intertemporal budget balance implies a cointegrating relationship between the primary deficit and the stock of debt**. This link between the components of the deficit and the stock of debt restricts the time series behavior of expenditures, taxes, and seigniorage, and this fact in turn implies that empirical modeling of their behavior should be carried out within the framework of a *vector error correction model (VECM)*.

Suppose $ X_{t}=\left(g_{t} \quad T_{t} \quad b_{t-1}\right), $ where $ T=t+s $ is defined as total government receipts from taxes and seigniorage. If the elements of $ X $ are nonstationary, intertemporal budget balance implies that the deficit inclusive of interest, or $ (1 \quad-1 \quad r) X_{t}=  \beta^{\prime} X_{t}=g_{t}-T_{t}+r b_{t-1}$, is stationary. Hence, $ \beta^{\prime}=(1 \quad-1 \quad r) $ is a cointegrating vector for $ X $. The appropriate specification of the time series process is then a VECM of the form
$$
C(L) \Delta X_{t}=-\alpha \beta^{\prime} X_{t}+e_{t} \tag{4.14}
$$
The presence of the deficit inclusive of interest, $ \beta^{\prime} X_{t}, $ ensures that the elements of $ X $ cannot drift too far apart; doing so would violate intertemporal budget balance. A number of authors have tested for cointegration to examine the sustainability of budget policies (e.g., Trehan and Walsh 1988 ; 1991). However, Bohn (2007) argued that time series tests based on cointegration relationships are not capable of rejecting intertemporal budget balance.

Bohn (1991a) estimated a model of the form (4.14) using U.S. data from 1800 to 1988. Unfortunately for the purposes here, Bohn did not treat seigniorage separately, and thus his results are not directly relevant for determining the effects of spending or tax shocks on the adjustment of seigniorage. He did find, however, that one-half to two-thirds of deficits initiated by a tax revenue shock were eventually eliminated by spending adjustments, and about one-third of spending shocks were essentially permanent and resulted in tax changes.

### 4.4.1 Ricardian and (Traditional) Non-Ricardian Fiscal Policies

Changes in the nominal quantity of money engineered through lump-sum taxes and transfers (as in chapters 2 and 3 ) may have different effects than changes introduced through **open market operations in which non-interest-bearing government debt is exchanged for interest-bearing debt**. In an early contribution, Metzler (1951) argued that an open market purchase, that is, an increase in the nominal quantity of money held by the public and an offsetting reduction in the nominal stock of interest-bearing debt held by the public, would raise the price level less than proportionally to the increase in $ M . $ An open market operation would therefore affect the real stock of money and lead to a change in the equilibrium rate of interest. Metzler assumed that households' desired portfolio holdings of bonds and money depended on the expected return on bonds. An open market operation, by altering the ratio of bonds to money, requires a change in the rate of interest to induce private agents to hold the new portfolio composition of bonds and money. A price level change proportional to the change in the nominal money supply would not restore equilibrium, because it would not restore the original ratio of nominal bonds to nominal money. 

An important limitation of Metzler's analysis was its dependence on portfolio behavior that was not derived directly from the decision problem facing the agents of the model. The analysis was also limited in that it ignored the consequence for future taxes of shifts in the composition of the government's debt, a point made by Patinkin (1965). It has been noted that the government's intertemporal budget constraint requires the government to run surpluses in present value terms equal to its current outstanding interest-bearing debt. An open market purchase by the monetary authority reduces the stock of interest-bearing debt held by the public, and this reduction will have consequences for future expected taxes.

**Sargent and Wallace (1981)** showed that the backing for government debt, whether it is ultimately paid for by taxes or by printing money, is important in determining the effects of debt issuance and open market operations. This finding can be illustrated following the analysis of Aiyagari and Gertler (1985). They used a *two-period overlapping-generations model* that allows debt policy to affect the real intergenerational distribution of wealth. This effect is absent from the *representative-agent models* used here, but the representative-agent framework can still be used to show how the specification of fiscal policy will have important implications for conclusions about the link between the money supply and the price level.

In order to focus on debt, taxes, and seigniorage, **set government purchases equal to zero and ignore population and real income growth**, in which case the government's budget constraint takes the simplified form
$$
\left(1+r_{t-1}\right) b_{t-1}=t_{t}+b_{t}+s_{t} \tag{4.15}
$$
with $ s_{t} $ denoting seigniorage. 

In addition to the government's budget constraint, the *budget constraint of the representative agent* must be specified. Assume that this agent receives an exogenous endowment $ y $ in each period and pays (lump-sum) taxes $ t_{t} $ in period $ t $. She also receives interest payments on any government debt held at the start of the period; these payments, in real terms, are given by $ \left(1+i_{t-1}\right) B_{t-1} / P_{t}, $ where $ i_{t-1} $ is the nominal interest rate in period $ t-1$, $B_{t-1} $ is the number of bonds held at the start of period $ t, $ and $ P_{t} $ is the period $ t $ price level. This can be written equivalently as $ \left(1+r_{t-1}\right) b_{t-1}, $ where $ r_{t-1}=\left(1+i_{t-1}\right) /\left(1+\pi_{t}\right)-1 $ is the ex post real rate of interest. Finally, the agent has real money balances equal to $ M_{t-1} / P_{t}=\left(1+\pi_{t}\right)^{-1} m_{t-1} $ that are carried into period $ t $ from period $ t-1 . $ The agent allocates these resources to consumption, real money holdings, and real bond purchases, subject to
$$
c_{t}+m_{t}+b_{t}=y+\left(1+r_{t-1}\right) b_{t-1}+\frac{m_{t-1}}{1+\pi_{t}}-t_{t} \tag{4.16}
$$
Aiyagari and Gertler (1985) asked whether the price level will depend only on the stock of money or whether debt policy and the behavior of the stock of debt might also be relevant for price level determination. They assumed that the government sets taxes to back a fraction $ \psi $ of its interest-bearing debt liabilities, with $ 0 \leq \psi \leq 1 . $ If $ \psi=1, $ government interest-bearing debt is completely backed by taxes in the sense that the government commits to maintaining the present discounted value of current and future tax receipts equal to its outstanding debt liabilities. Such a fiscal policy was called Ricardian by Sargent (1982). If $ \psi<1, $ Aiyagari and Gertler characterized fiscal policy as non-Ricardian. To avoid confusion with the more recent interpretations of non-Ricardian regimes (see section 4.5.2), let regimes where $ \psi<1 $ be referred to as *traditional non-Ricardian regimes*. In such regimes, seigniorage must adjust to maintain the present value of taxes plus seigniorage equal to the government's outstanding debt.

Let $ T_{t} $ now denote the present discounted value of taxes. Under the assumed debt policy, the government ensures that $ T_{t}=\psi\left(1+r_{t-1}\right) b_{t-1} $ because $ \left(1+r_{t-1}\right) b_{t-1} $ is the net liability of the government (including its current interest payment). Because $ T_{t} $ is a present value, one can also write
$$
 T_{t}=t_{t}+\mathrm{E}_{t}\left(\frac{T_{t+1}}{1+r_{t}}\right)=t_{t}+\mathrm{E}_{t}\left[\frac{\psi\left(1+r_{t}\right) b_{t}}{\left(1+r_{t}\right)}\right] 
$$
or $ T_{t}=t_{t}+\psi b_{t} . $ Now because $ T_{t}=\psi\left(1+r_{t-1}\right) b_{t-1}, $ it follows that
$$
 t_{t}=\psi\left(R_{t-1} b_{t-1}-b_{t}\right) \tag{4.17}
$$
where $ R=1+r . $ Similarly, $ s_{t}=(1-\psi)\left(R_{t-1} b_{t-1}-b_{t}\right) . $ With taxes adjusting to ensure that the fraction $ \psi $ of the government's debt liabilities is backed by taxes, the remaining fraction, $ 1-\psi, $ represents the portion backed by seigniorage. Using (4.17), the household's budget constraint (4.16) becomes
$$
c_{t}+m_{t}+(1-\psi) b_{t}=y+(1-\psi) R_{t-1} b_{t-1}+\frac{m_{t-1}}{1+\pi_{t}}
$$
In the Ricardian case $ (\psi=1) $, all terms involving the government's debt drop out; only the stock of money matters. If $ \psi<1, $ however, debt does not drop out. The budget constraint can then be written as 
$$
 y+R_{t-1} w_{t-1}=c_{t}+w_{t}+i_{t-1} m_{t-1} /\left(1+\pi_{t}\right) 
$$
 where $ w=m+(1-\psi) b $, showing that the relevant measure of household income is $ y+R_{t-1} w_{t-1} $ and this is then used to purchase consumption, financial assets, or money balances (where the opportunity cost of money is $ i /(1+\pi)) $. With asset demand depending on $ \psi $ through $ w_{t-1} $, the equilibrium price level and nominal rate of interest will generally depend on $ \psi $.

Having derived the representative agent's budget constraint and shown how it is affected by the means the government uses to back its debt, in order to actually determine the effects on the equilibrium price level and nominal interest rate, one must determine the agent's demand for money and bonds and then equate these demands to the (exogenous) supplies. To illustrate the role of debt policy, assume **logseparable utility**, $ \ln c_{t}+\delta \ln m_{t}, $ and consider a perfect foresight equilibrium. From chapter 2, the marginal rate of substitution between money and consumption will be set equal to $ i_{t} /\left(1+i_{t}\right) . $ With log utility, this implies $ m_{t}=\delta c_{t}\left(1+i_{t}\right) / i_{t} $. The **Euler condition** for the optimal consumption path yields $ c_{t+1}=\beta\left(1+r_{t}\right) c_{t} $. Using these in the agent's budget constraint,
$$
\begin{aligned}
y+R_{t-1} w_{t-1} &=c_{t}+w_{t}+\left(\frac{i_{t-1}}{1+\pi_{t}}\right) \delta\left(\frac{1+i_{t-1}}{i_{t-1}}\right) \frac{c_{t}}{\beta\left(1+r_{t-1}\right)} \\
&=\left(1+\frac{\delta}{\beta}\right) c_{t}+w_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

In equilibrium, $ c_{t}=y, $ so this becomes $ R_{t-1} w_{t-1}=(\delta / \beta) y+w_{t} . $ In the steady state, $ w_{t}=w_{t-1}=w^{s s}=\delta y / [\beta(R-1)] $. But $ w=[M+(1-\psi) B] / P, $ so the equilibrium steady-state price level is equal to
$$
P^{s s}=\left(\frac{\beta r^{s s}}{\delta y}\right)[M+(1-\psi) B] . \tag{4.18}
$$
If government debt is entirely backed by taxes $ (\psi=1), $ one gets the standard result; the price level is proportional to the nominal stock of money. The stock of debt has no effect on the price level. With $ 0<\psi<1 $, however, both the nominal money supply and the nominal stock of debt play a role in price level determination. Proportional changes in $ M $ and $ B $ produce proportional changes in the price level.

In a steady state, all nominal quantities and the price level must change at the same rate because real values are constant. Thus, if $ M $ grows, then $ B $ must also grow at the same rate. The real issue is **whether the composition of the government's liabilities matters for the price level**. To focus more clearly on that issue, let $ \lambda= $ $ M /(M+B) $ be the fraction of government liabilities that consists of non-interest bearing debt. Since open market operations affect the relative proportions of money and bonds in government liabilities, open market operations determine $ \lambda $. Equation (4.18) can then be written as
$$
P^{s s}=\left(\frac{\beta r^{s s}}{\delta y}\right)[1-\psi(1-\lambda)](M+B)
$$
**Open market purchases (an increase in $ \lambda) $ that substitute money for bonds but leave $ M+B $ unchanged raise $ P^{s s} $ when $ \psi>0$.** The rise in $ P^{s s} $ is not proportional to the increase in $ M $. Shifting the composition of its liabilities away from interest-bearing debt reduces the present discounted value of the private sector's tax liabilities by less than the fall in debt holdings; a rise in the price level proportional to the rise in $ M $ would leave households' real wealth lower (their bond holdings are reduced in real value, but the decline in the real value of their tax liabilities is only $ \psi<1 $ times as large).

Leeper (1991) argued that even if $ \psi=1 $ on average (that is, all debt is backed by taxes), the means used to finance shocks to the government's budget have important implications. He distinguished between active and passive policies; with an active monetary policy and a passive fiscal policy, monetary policy acts to target nominal interest rates and does not respond to the government's debt, while fiscal policy must then adjust taxes to ensure intertemporal budget balance. Conversely, with an active fiscal policy and a passive monetary policy, the monetary authority must adjust seigniorage revenues to ensure intertemporal budget balance, while fiscal policy does not respond to shocks to debt. Leeper showed that the inflation and debt processes are unstable if both policy authorities follow active policies, and there is price level indeterminacy if both follow passive policies.

### 4.4.2 The Government Budget Constraint and the Nominal Rate of Interest

Earlier, we examined Sargent and Wallace's "unpleasant monetarist arithmetic" using (4.13). Given the government's real liabilities, the monetary authority would be forced to finance any difference between these real liabilities and the present discounted value of the government's fiscal surpluses. Fiscal considerations determine the money supply, but the traditional quantity theory holds and the price level is proportional to the nominal quantity of money. Suppose, however, that the initial nominal stock of money is set exogenously by the monetary authority. Does this mean that the price level is determined solely by monetary policy, with no effect of fiscal policy? The following example shows that the answer is no; fiscal policy can affect the initial equilibrium price level, even when the initial nominal quantity of money is given and the government's intertemporal budget constraint must be satisfied at all price levels.

Consider a perfect-foresight equilibrium. In such an equilibrium, the government's budget constraint must be satisfied and the real demand for money must equal the real supply of money. The money-in-the-utility function (MIU) model of chapter 2 can be used, for example, to derive the real demand for money. That model implied that agents would equate the marginal rate of substitution between money and consumption to the cost of holding money, where this cost depended on the nominal rate of interest:
$$
\frac{u_{m}\left(c_{t}, m_{t}\right)}{u_{c}\left(c_{t}, m_{t}\right)}=\frac{i_{t}}{1+i_{t}}
$$
Using the utility function employed in chapter 2, this condition implies that
$$
 m_{t}=\frac{M_{t}}{P_{t}}=\left[\left(\frac{i_{t}}{1+i_{t}}\right)\left(\frac{a}{1-a}\right)\right]^{-1 / b} c_{t} 
$$
Evaluated at the economy's steady state, this can be written as
$$
\frac{M_{t}}{P_{t}}=f\left(R_{m, t}\right) \tag{4.19}
$$
where $ R_{m}=1+i $ is the gross nominal rate of interest and
$$
f\left(R_{m}\right)=\left[\left(\frac{R_{m}-1}{R_{m}}\right)\left(\frac{a}{1-a}\right)\right]^{-1 / b} c_{t}
$$
Given the nominal interest rate, (4.19) implies a proportional relationship between the nominal quantity of money and the equilibrium price level. If the initial money stock is $ M_{0} $, then the initial price level is $ P_{0}=M_{0} / f\left(R_{m}\right) $.

The government's budget constraint must also be satisfied. In a perfect-foresight equilibrium, there are no inflation surprises, so the government's budget constraint given by (4.5) can be written as
$$
g_{t}+r b_{t-1}=t_{t}+\left(b_{t}-b_{t-1}\right)+m_{t}-\left(\frac{1}{1+\pi_{t}}\right) m_{t-1} \tag{4.20}
$$
Now consider a stationary equilibrium in which government expenditures and taxes are constant, as are the real stocks of government interest-bearing debt and money. In such a stationary equilibrium, the budget constraint becomes
$$
g+\left(\frac{1}{\beta}-1\right) b=t+\left(\frac{\pi_{t}}{1+\pi_{t}}\right) m=t+\left(\frac{\beta R_{m}-1}{\beta R_{m}}\right) f\left(R_{m}\right) \tag{4.21}
$$
which uses the steady-state results that the gross real interest rate is $ 1 / \beta, R_{m} \equiv $ $ \left(1+\pi_{t}\right) / \beta, $ and real money balances must be consistent with the demand given by (4.19)

Suppose the fiscal authority sets $ g, t, $ and $ b $. Then (4.21) determines the nominal interest rate $ R_{m} $. With $ g, t, $ and $ b $ given, the government needs to raise $ g+(1 / \beta- 1) b-t $ in seigniorage. The nominal interest rate is determined by the requirement that this level of seigniorage be raised. $ ^{15} $ Because the nominal interest rate is equal to $ (1+\pi) / \beta, $ one can alternatively say that fiscal policy determines the inflation rate. Once the nominal interest rate is determined, the initial price level is given by (4.19) as $ P_{0}=M_{0} / f\left(R_{m}\right), $ where $ M_{0} $ is the initial stock of money. In subsequent periods, the price level is equal to $ P_{t}=P_{0}\left(\beta R_{m}\right)^{t}, $ where $ \beta R_{m}=(1+\pi) $ is the gross inflation rate. The nominal stock of money in each future period is endogenously determined by $ M_{t}=P_{t} f\left(R_{m}\right) . $ In this case, even though the monetary authority has set $ M_{0} $ exogenously, the initial price level is determined by the need for fiscal solvency because the fiscal authority's budget requirement (4.21) determines $ R_{m} $ and therefore the real demand for money. The initial price level is proportional to the initial money stock, but the factor of proportionality, $ 1 / f\left(R_{m}\right), $ is determined by fiscal policy, and both the rate of inflation and the path of the future nominal money supply are determined by the fiscal requirement that seigniorage equal $ g+(1 / \beta-1) b-t $.

**If the fiscal authority raises expenditures, holding $ b $ and $ t $ constant, then seigniorage must rise. The equilibrium nominal interest rate rises to generate this additional seigniorage**. $ ^{16} $ With a higher $ R_{m} $, the real demand for money falls, and this increases the equilibrium value of the initial price level $ P_{0}, $ even though the initial nominal quantity of money is unchanged.

### 4.4.3 Equilibrium Seigniorage

Suppose that, given its expenditures and other tax sources, the government has a fiscal deficit of $ \Delta^{f} $ that must be financed by money creation. When will it be feasible to raise $ \Delta^{f} $ in a steady-state equilibrium? And what will be the equilibrium rate of inflation?

The answers to these questions would be straightforward if there were a one-to-one relationship between the revenue generated by the inflation tax and the inflation rate. If this were the case, the inflation rate would be uniquely determined by the amount of revenue that must be raised. But the inflation rate affects the base against which the tax is levied. For a given base, a higher inflation rate raises seigniorage, but **a higher inflation rate raises the opportunity cost of holding money and reduces the demand for money, thereby lowering the base against which the tax is levied**. This raises the possibility that a given amount of revenue can be raised by more than one rate of inflation. For example, the nominal rate of interest $ R_{m} $ that satisfies (4.21) may not be unique.

It will be helpful to impose additional structure so that one can say more about the demand for money. The standard approach used in most analyses of seigniorage is to specify directly a functional form for the demand for money as a function of the nominal rate of interest. An early example of this approach, and one of the most influential, is that of Cagan (1956). This approach is discussed later, but first Calvo and Leiderman (1992) are followed in using a variant of the Sidrauski model of chapter 2 to motivate a demand for money. That is, suppose the economy consists of identical individuals, and the utility of the representative agent is given by
$$
 \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^{t} u\left(c_{t}, m_{t}\right) \tag{4.22}
$$
where $ 0<\beta<1, c $ is per capita consumption, $ m $ is per capita real money holdings, and the function $ u(.) $ is strictly concave and twice continuously differentiable. The representative agent chooses consumption, money balances, and holdings of interest-earning bonds to maximize the expected value of $ (4.22), $ subject to the following budget constraint:
$$
 c_{t}+b_{t}+m_{t}=y_{t}-\tau_{t}+(1+r) b_{t-1}+\frac{m_{t-1}}{\Pi_{t}} 
$$
where $ b $ is the agent's holdings of bonds, $ y $ is real income, $ \tau $ is equal to the net taxes of the agent, $ r $ is the real rate of interest, assumed constant for simplicity, and $ \Pi_{t} \equiv $ $ P_{t} / P_{t-1}=1+\pi_{t}, $ where $ \pi_{t} $ is the inflation rate. Thus, the last term in the budget constraint, $ m_{t-1} / \Pi_{t}, $ is equal to the period $ t $ real value of money balances carried into period $ t, $ that is, $ M_{t-1} / P_{t}, $ where $ M $ represents nominal money holdings. Attention is restricted to perfect-foresight equilibria.

If $ w_{t} $ is the agent's real wealth in period $ t, w_{t}=b_{t}+m_{t}, $ and $ R_{t}=1+r_{t}, $ then the budget constraint can be rewritten as
$$
\begin{aligned}
c_{t}+w_{t} &=y_{t}-\tau_{t}+R_{t-1} w_{t-1}-\left(\frac{R_{t-1} \Pi_{t}-1}{\Pi_{t}}\right) m_{t-1} \\
&=y_{t}-\tau_{t}+R_{t-1} w_{t-1}-\left(\frac{i_{t-1}}{\Pi_{t}}\right) m_{t-1}
\end{aligned}
$$
by using the fact that $ R \Pi=1+i, $ where $ i $ is the nominal rate of interest. When the budget constraint is written in this way, it is clear that the cost of holding wealth in the form of money as opposed to interest-earning bonds is $ i / \Pi .^{17} $ The first-order condition for optimal money holdings sets the marginal utility of money equal to the cost of holding money times the marginal utility of wealth. Since the interest forgone by holding money in period $ t $ is a cost that is incurred in period $ t+1, $ this cost must be discounted back to period $ t $ using the discount factor $ \beta $ to compare with the marginal utility of money in period $ t . $ Thus, $ u_{m}\left(c_{t}, m_{t}\right)=\beta\left(i_{t} / \Pi_{t+1}\right) u_{c}\left(c_{t+1}, m_{t+1}\right) . $ But the standard Euler condition for optimal consumption implies that $ u_{c}\left(c_{t}, m_{l}\right)= $ $ \beta R_{t} u_{c}\left(c_{t+1}, m_{t+1}\right) . $ Combining these first-order conditions yields
$$
u_{m}\left(c_{t}, m_{t}\right)=\left(\frac{i_{t}}{R_{t} \Pi_{t+1}}\right) u_{c}\left(c_{t}, m_{t}\right)=\left(\frac{i_{t}}{1+i_{t}}\right) u_{c}\left(c_{t}, m_{t}\right) \tag{4.23}
$$
Now suppose the utility function takes the form $ u\left(c_{t}, m_{t}\right)=\ln c_{t}+m_{t}\left(B-D \ln m_{t}\right) $ Using this functional form in $ (4.23), $ one obtains
$$
m_{t}=A e^{-\omega_{t} / D c_{t}} \tag{4.24}
$$
where $ A=e^{(B / D-1)} $ and $ \omega=i /(1+i) . $ Equation (4.24) provides a convenient functional representation for the demand for money.

Since the time of Cagan's seminal contribution to the study of seigniorage and hyperinflations (Cagan $ 1956,158-161), $ many economists have followed him in specifying a money demand function of the form $ m=K e^{-\alpha \pi^{e}} ;(4.24) $ shows how something similar can be derived from an underlying utility function. As Calvo and Leiderman (1992) pointed out, the advantage is that one sees how the parameters $ K $ and $ \alpha $ depend on more primitive parameters of the representative agent's preferences and how they may actually be time-dependent. For example, $ \alpha $ depends on $ c_{l} $ and therefore will be time-dependent unless $ K $ varies appropriately or $ c $ itself is constant. The reason for deriving the demand for money as a function of the rate of inflation is that, having done so, one can express seigniorage as a function of the rate of inflation. Recall from (4.9) that seigniorage was equal to $ \mathrm{im} /(1+\pi)=(1+r) i m /(1+i) $. Using the expression for the demand for money, steady-state seigniorage is equal to
$$
 \bar{s}=(1+r)\left(\frac{i}{1+i}\right) A \exp \left[-\frac{i}{D c(1+i)}\right] 
$$
If superneutrality is assumed to characterize the model, then $ c $ will be constant in the steady state and independent of the rate of inflation. The same will be true of the real rate of interest.

To determine how seigniorage varies with the rate of inflation, think of choosing $ \omega=i /(1+i) $ through the choice of $ \pi . $ Then $ \bar{s}=(1+r) \omega A e^{-\omega / D c} $ and $ \partial \bar{s} / \partial \pi=  (\partial \bar{s} / \partial \omega)(\partial \omega / \partial i)(\partial i / \partial \pi)=(\partial \bar{s} / \partial \omega)(1+r) /(1+i)^{2}$, so the sign of $ \partial \bar{s} / \partial \pi $ will be deter-
mined by the sign of $ (\partial \bar{s} / \partial \omega) . $ Since
$$
 \frac{\partial \bar{s}}{\partial \omega}=(1+r) A e^{-\omega / D c}\left[1-\frac{\omega}{D c}\right]=\frac{\bar{s}}{\omega}\left[1-\frac{\omega}{D c}\right] 
$$
the sign of $ \partial \bar{s} / \partial \omega $ depends on the sign of $ 1-(\omega / D c) . $ As illustrated in figure $ 4.1, $ seigniorage increases with inflation initially but eventually begins to decline with further increases in $ \pi $ as the demand for real balances shrinks. $ { }^{18} $

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed/Figs/20210402152403.png)

To determine the inflation rate that maximizes seigniorage, note that $ \partial \bar{s} / \partial \pi=0 $ if and only if
$$
\omega=\frac{i}{1+i}=D c, \quad \text { or } \quad \pi^{\max }=\left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right)\left(\frac{1}{1-D c}\right)-1 .
$$
For inflation rates less than $ \pi^{\max }, $ the government's revenue is increasing in the inflation rate. The effect of an increase in the tax rate dominates the effect of higher inflation in reducing the real demand for money. As inflation increases above $ \pi^{\max }, $ the tax base shrinks sufficiently that revenues from seigniorage decline. Consequently, governments face a **seigniorage Laffer curve**; raising inflation beyond a certain point results in lower real tax revenue.

### 4.4.4 Cagan’s Model

Since 1970 the consumer price index for the United States has risen just over 5.5 -fold; that is inflation. $ { }^{19} $ In Hungary, the index of wholesale prices was 38,500 in January 1923 and 1,026,000 in January $ 1924, $ one year later, a 27 -fold increase; that is hyperinflation (Sargent 1986,64$ ) $

One of the earliest studies of the dynamics of money and prices during hyperinflation was done by Cagan (1956). The discussion here follows Cagan in using continuous time. Suppose the real per capita fiscal deficit that needs to be financed is exogenously given and is equal to $ \Delta^{f} $. This means that
$$
 \Delta^{f}=\frac{\dot{H}}{H} \frac{H}{P Y}=\theta h 
$$
where $ h $ is expressed as real balances relative to income to allow for real economic growth. The demand for real balances will depend on the nominal interest rate and therefore the expected rate of inflation. Treating real variables such as the real rate of interest and the growth rate of real output as constant (which is appropriate in a steady state characterized by superneutrality and is usually taken as reasonable during hyperinflations because all the action involves money and prices), write the demand for the real monetary base as $ h=\exp \left(-\alpha \pi^{e}\right) . $ Then the government's revenue requirement implies that
$$
 \Delta^{f}=\theta e^{-\alpha \pi^{\epsilon}}  \tag{4.25}
$$
For $ h $ to be constant in equilibrium requires that $ \pi=\theta-\mu, $ where $ \mu $ is the growth rate of real income. And in a steady-state equilibrium, $ \pi^{e}=\pi, $ so (4.25) becomes
$$
 \Delta^{f}=\theta e^{-\alpha(\theta-\mu)} \tag{4.26}
$$
the solution(s) of which give the rates of money growth that are consistent with raising the amount $ \Delta^{f} $ through seigniorage. The right side of (4.26) equals zero when money growth is equal to zero, rises to a maximum at $ \theta=(1 / \alpha), $ and then declines. $ { }^{20} $ That is, for rates of money growth above $ (1 / \alpha), $ and therefore inflation rates above $ (1 / \alpha)-\mu, $ higher inflation actually leads to lower revenues because the tax base falls sufficiently to offset the rise in inflation. Thus, any deficit less than $ \Delta^{*}= $ $ (1 / \alpha) \exp (\alpha \mu-1) $ can be financed by either a low rate of inflation or a high rate of inflation.

Figure 4.2, based on Bruno and Fischer (1990), illustrates the two inflation rates consistent with seigniorage revenues of $ \Delta^{f} . $ The curve $ S R $ is derived from (4.25) and shows, for each rate of money growth, the expected rate of inflation needed to generate the required seigniorage revenues. $ ^{21} $ The $ 45^{\circ} $ line gives the steady-state inflation

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed/Figs/20210402152623.png)

rate as a function of the money growth rate: $ \pi^{e}=\pi=\theta-\mu $. The two points of intersection labeled $ A $ and $ D $ are the two solutions to (4.26)

What determines whether, for a given deficit, the economy ends up at the highinflation equilibrium or the low-inflation equilibrium? Which equilibrium is picked out depends on the stability properties of the economy. Determining this in turn requires a more complete specification of the dynamics of the model. Recall that the demand for money depends on expected inflation through the nominal rate of interest, whereas the inflation tax rate depends on actual inflation. In considering the effects of variations in the inflation rate, one needs to determine how expectations will adjust. Cagan (1956) addressed this by assuming that expectations adjust adaptively to actual inflation:
$$
\frac{\partial \pi^{e}}{\partial t}=\dot{\pi}^{e}=\eta\left(\pi-\pi^{e}\right) \tag{4.27}
$$
where $ \eta $ captures the "speed of adjustment" of expectations. A low $ \eta $ implies that expectations respond slowly to inflation forecast errors. Since $ h=\exp \left(-\alpha \pi^{e}\right), $ differentiate this expression with respect to time, obtaining
$$
\frac{\dot{h}}{h}=\theta-\mu-\pi=-\alpha \dot{\pi}^{e}
$$
Solving for $ \pi $ using (4.27) yields $ \pi=\theta-\mu+\alpha \dot{\pi}^{e}=\theta-\mu+\alpha \eta\left(\pi-\pi^{e}\right), $ or $ \pi=(\theta- $
$ \left.\mu-\alpha \eta \pi^{e}\right) /(1-\alpha \eta) . $ Substituting this back into the expectations adjustment equation gives
$$
\dot{\pi}^{e}=\frac{\eta\left(\theta-\mu-\pi^{e}\right)}{1-\alpha \eta} \tag{4.28}
$$
which implies that the low-inflation equilibrium will be stable as long as $ \alpha \eta<1 $. This requires that expectations adjust sufficiently slowly $ (\eta<1 / \alpha) $.

If expectations adjust adaptively and sufficiently slowly, what happens when the deficit is increased? Since the demand for real money balances depends on expected inflation, and because the adjustment process does not allow the expected inflation rate to jump immediately, the higher deficit can be financed by an increase in the rate of inflation (assuming the new deficit is still below the maximum that can be financed, $ \Delta^{*} $ ). Since actual inflation now exceeds expected inflation, $ \dot{\pi}^{e}>0 $ and $ \pi^{e} $ begins to rise. The economy converges into a new equilibrium at a higher rate of inflation.

In terms of figure $ 4.2, $ an increase in the deficit shifts the $ S R $ line to the right to $ S^{\prime} R^{\prime} $ (for a given expected rate of inflation, money growth must rise in order to generate more revenue). Assume that initially the economy is at point $ A $, the low-inflation equilibrium. Budget balance requires that the economy be on the $ S^{\prime} R^{\prime} $ line, so $ \theta $ jumps to the rate associated with point $ B $. But now, at point $ B $, inflation has risen and $ \pi^{e}<\pi=\theta-\mu . $ Expected inflation rises (as long as $ \alpha \eta<1 ; $ see $ \left.(4.28)\right) $, and the economy converges to $ C $. The high-inflation equilibrium, in contrast, is unstable.

Adaptive expectations of the sort Cagan assumed disappeared from the literature under the onslaught of the rational-expectations revolution begun by Lucas and Sargent in the early $ 1970 \mathrm{~s} $. If agents are systematically attempting to forecast inflation, then their forecast will depend on the actual process governing the evolution of inflation; rarely will this imply an adjustment process such as $ (4.27) . $ Stability in the Cagan model also requires that expectations not adjust too quickly $ (\eta<1 / \alpha), $ and this requirement conflicts with the rational-expectations notion that expectations adjust quickly in response to new information. Bruno and Fischer (1990) showed that, to some degree, assuming that agents adjust their holdings of real money balances slowly plays a role under rational expectations similar to the role played by the slow adjustment of expectations in Cagan's model in ensuring stability under adaptive expectations.

### 4.4.5 Rational Hyperinflation

Why do countries find themselves in situations of hyperinflation? Most explanations of hyperinflation point to fiscal policy as the chief culprit. Governments that are forced to print money to finance real government expenditures often end up generating hyperinflations. In that sense, rapid money growth does lead to hyperinflation, consistent with the relationship between money growth and inflation implied by the models examined so far, but money growth is no longer exogenous. Instead, it is endogenously determined by the need to finance a fiscal deficit. $ ^{22} $

**Two explanations for the development of hyperinflation suggest themselves**. 

1. In the **Cagan model** with adaptive expectations, suppose that $ \alpha \eta<1 $ so that the lowinflation equilibrium is stable. Now suppose that a shock pushes the inflation rate above the high-inflation equilibrium (above point $ D $ in figure 4.2 ). If that equilibrium is unstable, the economy continues to diverge, moving to higher and higher rates of inflation. So one explanation for hyperinflations is that they represent situations in which exogenous shocks push the economy into an unstable region.
2. Alternatively, suppose the deficit that needs to be financed with seigniorage grows. If it rises above $ \Delta^{*}, $ the maximum that can be financed by money creation, the government finds itself unable to obtain enough revenue, so it runs the printing presses faster, further reducing the real revenue it obtains and forcing it to print money even faster. **Most hyperinflations have occurred after wars (and on the losing side)**. Such countries face an economy devastated by war and a tax system that no longer functions effectively. At the same time, there are enormous demands on the government for expenditures to provide the basics of food and shelter and to rebuild the economy. Revenue needs outpace the government's ability to raise tax revenues. The ends of such hyperinflations usually involve a fiscal reform that allows the government to reduce its reliance on seigniorage (see Sargent 1986 ).

When expected inflation falls in response to the reforms, the opportunity cost of holding money is reduced and the demand for real money balances rises. Thus, the growth rate of the nominal money supply normally continues temporarily at a very high rate after a hyperinflation has ended. A similar, if smaller-scale, phenomenon occurred in the United States in the mid-1980s. The money supply, as measured by $ M 1 $, grew very rapidly. At the time, there were concerns that this growth would lead to a return of higher rates of inflation. Instead, it seemed to reflect the increased demand for money resulting from the decline in inflation from its peak levels in $ 1979- $ $ 1980 . $ The need for real money balances to grow as inflation is reduced often causes problems for establishing and maintaining the credibility of policies designed to reduce inflation. If a disinflation is credible, so that expected inflation falls, it may be necessary to increase the growth rate of the nominal money supply temporarily. But when inflation and rapid money growth are so closely related, letting money growth rise may be misinterpreted as a signal that the central bank has given up on its disinflation policy.

Fiscal theories of seigniorage, inflation, and hyperinflations are based on fundamentals-there really is a deficit that needs to be financed, and that is what leads to money creation. An alternative view of hyperinflations is that they are simply bubbles, similar to bubbles in financial markets. Such phenomena are based on the possibility of multiple equilibria in which expectations can be self-fulfilling.

To illustrate this possibility, suppose the real demand for money is given, in log terms, by
$$
 m_{t}-p_{t}=-\alpha\left(\mathrm{E}_{t} p_{t+1}-p_{t}\right) 
$$
where $ \mathrm{E}_{t} p_{t+1} $ denotes the expectation formed at time $ t $ of time $ t+1 $ prices and $ \alpha>0 $. This money demand function is the log version of Cagan's demand function. This equation can be rearranged to express the current price level as
$$
p_{t}=\left(\frac{1}{1+\alpha}\right) m_{t}+\left(\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha}\right) \mathrm{E}_{t} p_{t+1} \tag{4.29}
$$
Suppose that the growth rate of the nominal money supply process is given by $ m_{t}=\theta_{0}+(1-\gamma) \theta_{1} t+\gamma m_{t-1} $. Since $ m $ is the log money supply, the growth rate of the money supply is $ m_{t}-m_{t-1}=(1-\gamma) \theta_{1}+\gamma\left(m_{t-1}-m_{t-2}\right), $ and the trend (average) growth rate is $ \theta_{1} . $ Given this process, and the assumption that agents make use of it and the equilibrium condition (4.29) in forming their expectations, one solution for the price level is given by
$$
p_{t}=\frac{\alpha\left[\theta_{0}+(1-\gamma) \theta_{1}(1+\alpha)\right]}{1+\alpha(1-\gamma)}+\left[\frac{\alpha(1-\gamma) \theta_{1}}{1+\alpha(1-\gamma)}\right] t+\left[\frac{1}{1+\alpha(1-\gamma)}\right] m_{t} \\
 =A_{0}+A_{1} t+A_{2} m_{t} 
$$
That this is a solution can be verified by noting that it implies $ \mathrm{E}_{t} p_{t+1}=A_{0}+ $ $ A_{1}(t+1)+A_{2} \mathrm{E}_{t} m_{t+1}=A_{0}+A_{1}(t+1)+A_{2}\left[\theta_{0}+(1-\gamma) \theta_{1}(t+1)+\gamma m_{t}\right] ; $ substitut-
ing this into (4.29) yields the proposed solution. Under this solution, the inflation rate $ p_{t}-p_{t-1} $ converges to $ \theta_{1} $, the average growth rate of the nominal supply of money. $ { }^{23} $ Consider an alternative solution:
$$
p_{t}=A_{0}+A_{1} t+A_{2} m_{t}+B_{t} \tag{4.30}
$$
where $ B_{t} $ is time-varying. Does there exist a $ B_{t} $ process consistent with (4.29)$ ? $ Substituting the new proposed solution into the equilibrium condition for the price level yields
$$
A_{0}+A_{1} t+A_{2} m_{t}+B_{t}=\frac{m_{t}}{1+\alpha}+\frac{\alpha\left[A_{0}+A_{1}(t+1)+A_{2} \mathrm{E}_{t} m_{t+1}+\mathrm{E}_{t} B_{t+1}\right]}{1+\alpha}
$$
which, to hold for all realizations of the nominal money supply, requires that, as before, $ A_{0}=\alpha\left[\theta_{0}+(1-\gamma) \theta_{1}(1+\alpha)\right] /[1+\alpha(1-\gamma)], A_{1}=\alpha(1-\gamma) \theta_{1} /[1+\alpha(1-\gamma)] $
and $ A_{2}=1 /[1+\alpha(1-\gamma)] . $ This then implies that the $ B_{i} $ process must satisfy
$$
B_{t}=\left(\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha}\right) \mathrm{E}_{t} B_{t+1}
$$
which holds if $ B $ follows the explosive process
$$
B_{t+1}=k B_{t} \tag{4.31}
$$
for $ k=(1+\alpha) / \alpha>1 . $ In other words, (4.30) is an equilibrium solution for any process $ B_{t} $ satisfying $ (4.31) . $ Since $ B $ grows at the rate $ k-1=1 / \alpha, $ and since $ \alpha, $ the elasticity of money demand with respect to expected inflation, is normally thought to be small, its inverse would be large. The actual inflation rate along a bubble solution path could greatly exceed the rate of money growth.

Obstfeld and Rogoff (1983; 1986) considered whether speculative hyperinflations are consistent with equilibrium when agents are utility-maximizing. As discussed in section 2.2.1, they showed that speculative hyperinflation in unbacked fiat money systems cannot generally be ruled out. Equilibrium paths may exist along which real money balances eventually converge to zero as the price level goes to $ +\infty $ (see also section 4.5.1).

The methods developed to test for bubbles are similar to those that have been employed to test for intertemporal budget balance. For example, if the nominal money stock is nonstationary, then the absence of bubbles implies that the price level will be nonstationary but cointegrated with the money supply. This is a testable implication of the no-bubble assumption. Equation (4.31) gives the simplest example of a bubble process. Evans (1991) showed how the cointegration tests can fail to detect bubbles that follow periodically collapsing processes. For more on asset prices and bubbles, see Shiller (1981) ; Mattey and Meese (1986) ; West $ (1987 ; 1988) ; $ Diba and Grossman $ (1988 \mathrm{a} ; 1988 \mathrm{~b}) ; $ and Evans (1991)

## 4.5 The Fiscal Theory of the Price Level

A number of researchers have examined models in which fiscal factors replace the money supply as the key determinant of the price level (see Leeper $ 1991 ; $ Sims $ 1994 ; $ Woodford 1995; 1999a; 2001a; Bohn 1999; Cochrane 1999; Kocherlakota and Phelen 1999 ; Daniel 2001; the excellent discussions by Carlstrom and Fuerst $ 1999 \mathrm{~b} $ and by Christiano and Fitzgerald 2000 and references they list; and the criticisms of the approach by McCallum 2001; Buiter 2002; and McCallum and Nelson 2005). The fiscal theory of the price level raises some important issues for both monetary theory and monetary policy.

There are two ways fiscal policy might matter for the price level. First, equilibrium requires that the real quantity of money equal the real demand for money. If fiscal variables affect the real demand for money, the equilibrium price level will also depend on fiscal factors (see section 4.4 .2$ ) $. This, however, is not the channel emphasized in fiscal theories of the price level. Instead, these theories focus on a second aspect of monetary models - there may be multiple price levels consistent with a given nominal quantity of money and equality between money supply and money demand. Fiscal policy may then determine which of these is the equilibrium price level. And in some cases, the equilibrium price level picked out by fiscal factors may be independent of the nominal supply of money.

In contrast to the standard monetary theories of the price level, the fiscal theory assumes that the government's intertemporal budget equation represents an equilibrium condition rather than a constraint that must hold for all price levels. At some price levels, the intertemporal budget constraint would be violated. Such price levels are not consistent with equilibrium. Given the stock of nominal debt, the equilibrium price level must ensure that the government's intertemporal budget is balanced.

The next section illustrates why the requirement that the real demand for money equal the real supply of money may not be sufficient to uniquely determine the equilibrium price level, even for a fixed nominal money supply. The subsequent section shows how fiscal considerations may serve to pin down the equilibrium price level.

### 4.5.1 Multiple Equilibria

The traditional quantity theory of money highlights the role the nominal stock of money plays in determining the equilibrium price level. Using the demand for money given by (4.19) , a proportional relationship is obtained between the nominal quantity of money and the equilibrium price level that depends on the nominal rate of interest. However, the nominal interest rate is also an endogenous variable, so (4.19) by itself may not be sufficient to determine the equilibrium price level. Because the nominal interest rate depends on the rate of inflation, (4.19) can be written as
$$
 \frac{M_{t}}{P_{t}}=f\left(R_{t} \frac{P_{t+1}}{P_{t}}\right) 
$$
where $ R $ is the gross real rate of interest. This forward difference equation in the price level may be insufficient to determine a unique equilibrium path for the price level. Consider a perfect-foresight equilibrium with a constant nominal supply of money, $ M_{0} . $ Suppose the real rate of return is equal to its steady-state value of $ 1 / \beta, $ and the demand for real money balances is given by $ (4.19) . $ One can then write the equilibrium between the real supply of money and the real demand for money as
$$
 \frac{M_{0}}{P_{t}}=g\left(\frac{P_{t+1}}{P_{t}}\right), \quad g^{\prime}<0 
$$
Under suitable regularity conditions on $ g(), $ this condition can be rewritten as
$$
P_{t+1}=P_{t} g^{-1}\left(\frac{M_{0}}{P_{t}}\right) \equiv \phi\left(P_{t}\right) \tag{4.32}
$$
Equation (4.32) defines a difference equation in the price level. One solution is $ P_{t+i}=P^{*} $ for all $ i \geq 0, $ where $ P^{*}=M_{0} / g(1) . $ In this equilibrium, the quantity theory holds, and the price level is proportional to the money supply.

This constant price level equilibrium is not, however, the only possible equilibrium. As noted in section 4.4 .5 and chapter $ 2, $ there may be equilibrium price paths starting from $ P_{0} \neq P^{*} $ that are fully consistent with the equilibrium condition $ (4.32) . $ For example, in figure $ 4.3, $ the convex curve shows $ \phi\left(P_{t}\right) $ as an increasing function of

![image-20210402153528133](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed/Figs/20210402153530.png)



$ P_{t} . $ Also shown in the figure is the $ 45^{\circ} $ line. Using the fact that $ g^{-1}\left(M_{0} / P^{*}\right)=1, $ the slope of $ \phi\left(P_{t}\right), $ evaluated at $ P^{*}, $ is
$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi^{\prime}\left(P^{*}\right) &=g^{-1}\left(M_{0} / P^{*}\right)-\left[\partial g^{-1}\left(M_{0} / P^{*}\right) / \partial\left(M_{0} / P^{*}\right)\right]\left(M_{0} / P^{*}\right) \\
&=1-\left[\partial g^{-1}\left(M_{0} / P^{*}\right) / \partial\left(M_{0} / P^{*}\right)\right]\left(M_{0} / P^{*}\right)>1
\end{aligned}
$$
Thus, $ \phi $ cuts the $ 45^{\circ} $ line from below at $ P^{*} $. Any price path starting at $ P_{0}=P^{\prime}>P^{*} $ is consistent with (4.32) and involves a positive rate of inflation. As the figure illustrates, $ P \rightarrow \infty, $ but the equilibrium condition (4.32) is satisfied along this path. As the price level explodes, real money balances go to zero. But this is consistent with private agents' demand for money because inflation and therefore nominal interest rates are rising, lowering the real demand for money. Any price level to the right of $ P^{*} $ is a valid equilibrium. These equilibria all involve speculative hyperinflations. (Equilibria originating to the left of $ P^{*} $ eventually violate a transversality condition because $ M / P $ is exploding as $ P \rightarrow 0 . $ ) By itself, (4.32) is not sufficient to uniquely determine the equilibrium value of $ P_{0}, $ even though the nominal quantity of money is fixed.

### 4.5.2 The Fiscal Theory

Standard models in which equilibrium depends on forward-looking expectations of the price level, a property of the models discussed in chapters 2 and $ 3, $ generally have multiple equilibria. Thus, an additional equilibrium condition may be needed to uniquely determine the price level. The fiscal theory of the price level focuses on situations in which the government's intertemporal budget constraint may supply that additional condition.

#### The Basic Idea 

The fiscal theory can be illustrated in the context of a model with a representative household and a government but no capital. The implications of the fiscal theory will be easiest to see if attention is restricted to perfect-foresight equilibria.

The representative household chooses its consumption and asset holdings optimally, subject to an intertemporal budget constraint. Suppose the period $ t $ budget constraint of the representative household takes the form
$$
 D_{t}+P_{t} y_{t}-T_{t} \geq P_{t} c_{t}+M_{t}^{d}+B_{t}^{d}=P_{t} c_{t}+\left(\frac{i_{t}}{1+i_{t}}\right) M_{t}^{d}+\left(\frac{1}{1+i_{t}}\right) D_{t+1}^{d} 
$$
where $ D_{t} $ is the household's beginning-of-period financial wealth and $ D_{t+1}^{d}= $ $ \left(1+i_{t}\right) B_{t}^{d}+M_{t}^{d} . $ The superscripts denote that $ M^{d} $ and $ B^{d} $ are the household's demand for money and interest-bearing debt. In real terms, this budget constraint becomes
$$
 d_{t}+y_{t}-\tau_{t} \geq c_{t}+m_{t}^{d}+b_{t}^{d}=c_{t}+\left(\frac{i_{t}}{1+i_{l}}\right) m_{t}^{d}+\left(\frac{1}{1+r_{t}}\right) d_{t+1}^{d} 
$$
where $ \tau_{t}=T_{t} / P_{t}, m_{t}^{d}=M_{t}^{d} / P_{t}, 1+r_{t}=\left(1+i_{t}\right)\left(1+\pi_{t+1}\right), $ and $ d_{t}=D_{t} / P_{t} . $ Let
$$
 \lambda_{t, t+i}=\prod_{j=1}^{i}\left(\frac{1}{1+r_{t+j}}\right) 
$$
be the discount factor, with $ \lambda_{t, t}=1 . $ Under standard assumptions, the household intertemporal budget constraint takes the form
$$
 d_{t}+\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \lambda_{t, t+i}\left(y_{t+i}-\tau_{t+i}\right)=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \lambda_{t, t+i}\left[c_{t+i}+\left(\frac{i_{t+i}}{1+i_{t+i}}\right) m_{t+i}^{d}\right] \tag{4.33}
$$
Household choices must satisfy this intertemporal budget constraint. The left side is the present discounted value of the household's initial real financial wealth and aftertax income. The right side is the present discounted value of consumption spending plus the real cost of holding money. This condition holds with equality because any path of consumption and money holdings for which the left side exceeded the right side would not be optimal; the household could increase its consumption at time $ t $ without reducing consumption or money holdings at any other date. As long as the household is unable to accumulate debts that exceed the present value of its resources, the right side cannot exceed the left side.

The budget constraint for the government sector, in nominal terms, takes the form
$$
P_{t} g_{t}+\left(1+i_{t-1}\right) B_{t-1}=T_{t}+M_{t}-M_{t-1}+B_{t} \tag{4.34}
$$
Dividing by $ P_{t}, $ this can be written as
$$
g_{t}+d_{t}=\tau_{t}+\left(\frac{i_{t}}{1+i_{l}}\right) m_{t}+\left(\frac{1}{1+r_{t}}\right) d_{t+1} .
$$
Recursively substituting for future values of $ d_{t+i}, $ this budget constraint implies that
$$
d_{t}+\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \lambda_{t, t+i}\left[g_{t+i}-\tau_{t+i}-\bar{s}_{t+i}\right]=\lim _{T \rightarrow \infty} \lambda_{t, t+T} d_{T} \tag{4.35}
$$
where $ \bar{s}_{t}=i_{t} m_{t} /\left(1+i_{t}\right) $ is the government's real seigniorage revenue. In previous sections, it was assumed that the expenditures, taxes, and seigniorage choices of the consolidated government (the combined monetary and fiscal authorities) were constrained by the requirement that $ \lim _{T \rightarrow \infty} \lambda_{t, t+T} d_{T}=0 $ for all price levels $ P_{t} . $ Policy paths for $ \left(g_{t+i}, \tau_{t+i}, s_{t+i}, d_{t+i}\right)_{i \geq 0} $ such that
$$
d_{t}+\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \lambda_{t, t+i}\left[g_{t+i}-\tau_{t+i}-\bar{s}_{t+i}\right]=\lim _{T \rightarrow \infty} \lambda_{t, t+T} d_{T}=0
$$
for all price paths $ p_{t+i}, i \geq 0 $ are called Ricardian policies. Policy paths for $ \left(g_{t+i}, \tau_{t+i},\right. $ $ \left.\bar{s}_{t+i}, d_{t+i}\right)_{i \geq 0} $ for which $ \lim _{T \rightarrow \infty} \lambda_{t, t+T} d_{T} $ may not equal zero for all price paths are
called non-Ricardian. $ { }^{24} $ 

Now consider a perfect-foresight equilibrium. Regardless of whether the government follows a Ricardian or a non-Ricardian policy, equilibrium in the goods market in this simple economy with no capital requires that $ y_{t}=c_{t}+g_{t} . $ The demand for money must also equal the supply of money: $ m_{t}^{d}=m_{t} . $ Substituting $ y_{t}-g_{t} $ for $ c_{t} $ and $ m_{l} $ for $ m_{l}^{d} $ in (4.33) and rearranging yields
$$
d_{t}+\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \lambda_{t, t+i}\left[g_{t+i}-\tau_{t+i}-\left(\frac{i_{t+i}}{1+i_{l+i}}\right) m_{t+i}\right]=0 \tag{4.36}
$$
Thus, an implication of the representative household's optimization problem and market equilibrium is that (4.36) must hold in equilibrium. Under Ricardian policies, (4.36) does not impose any additional restrictions on equilibrium because the policy variables are always adjusted to ensure that this condition holds. Under a nonRicardian policy, however, it does impose an additional condition that must be satisfied in equilibrium. To see what this condition involves, use the definition of $ d_{t} $ and seigniorage to write (4.36) as
$$
 \frac{D_{t}}{P_{t}}=\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \lambda_{t, t+i}\left[\tau_{t+i}+\bar{s}_{t+i}-g_{t+i}\right] \tag{4.37}
$$
At time $ t, $ the government's outstanding nominal liabilities $ D_{t} $ are predetermined by past policies. Given the present discounted value of the government's future surpluses (the right side of (4.37)$ ) $, the only endogenous variable is the current price level $ P_{t} $ The price level must adjust to ensure that (4.37) is satisfied.

Equation (4.37) is an equilibrium condition under non-Ricardian policies, but it is not the only equilibrium condition. It is still the case that real money demand and real money supply must be equal. Suppose the real demand for money is given by $ (4.19), $ rewritten here as
$$
 \frac{M_{t}}{P_{t}}=f\left(1+i_{t}\right) \tag{4.38}
$$
Equations (4.37) and (4.38) must both be satisfied in equilibrium. However, which two variables are determined jointly by these two equations depends on the assumptions that are made about fiscal and monetary policies. For example, suppose the fiscal authority determines $ g_{t+i} $ and $ \tau_{t+i} $ for all $ i \geq 0, $ and the monetary authority pegs the nominal rate of interest $ i_{t+i}=\bar{\imath} $ for all $ i \geq 0 $. Seigniorage is equal to $ \bar{\imath} f(1+\bar{\imath}) /(1+\bar{\imath}) $ and so is fixed by monetary policy. With this specification of monetary and fiscal policies, the right side of (4.37) is given. Since $ D_{t} $ is predetermined at date $ t,(4.37) $ can be solved for the equilibrium price level $ P_{t}^{*} $ given by
$$
 P_{t}^{*}=\frac{D_{t}}{\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \lambda_{t, t+i}\left[\tau_{t+i}+\bar{s}_{t+i}-g_{t+i}\right]} \tag{4.39}
$$
The current nominal money supply is then determined by (4.38):
$$
 M_{t}=P_{t}^{*} f(1+\bar{\imath}) 
$$
One property of this equilibrium is that changes in fiscal policy $ (g $ or $ \tau) $ directly alter the equilibrium price level, even though seigniorage as measured by $ \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \lambda_{t, t+i} \bar{s}_{t+i} $ is unaffected. $ ^{25} $ The finding that the price level is uniquely determined by (4.39) contrasts with a standard conclusion that the price level is indeterminate under a nominal interest rate peg. This conclusion is obtained from (4.38): with $ i $ pegged, the right side of (4.38) is fixed, but this only determines the real supply of money. Any price level is consistent with equilibrium, as $ M $ then adjusts to ensure that (4.38) holds. Critical to the fiscal theory is the assumption that $ (4.37), $ the government's intertemporal budget constraint, is an equilibrium condition that holds at the equilibrium price level and not a condition that must hold at all price levels. This means that at price levels not equal to $ P_{t}^{*} $, the government is planning to run surpluses (including seigniorage) whose real value, in present discounted terms, is not equal to the government's outstanding real liabilities. Similarly, it means that the government could cut current taxes, leaving current and future government expenditures and seigniorage unchanged, and not simultaneously plan to raise future taxes. $ ^{26} $ When (4.37) is interpreted as a budget constraint that must be satisfied for all price levels, that is, under Ricardian policies, any decision to cut taxes today (and so lower the right side of (4.37)) must be accompanied by planned future tax increases to leave the right side unchanged.

In standard infinite-horizon, representative-agent models, a tax cut (current and future government expenditures unchanged) has no effect on equilibrium (i.e., Ricardian equivalence holds) because the tax reduction does not have a real wealth effect on private agents. Agents recognize that in a Ricardian regime, future taxes have risen in present value terms by an amount exactly equal to the reduction in current taxes. Alternatively expressed, the government cannot engineer a permanent tax cut unless government expenditures are also cut (in present value terms). Because the fiscal theory of the price level assumes that (4.37) holds only when evaluated at the equilibrium price level, the government can plan a permanent tax cut. If it does, the price level must rise to ensure that the new, lower value of discounted surpluses is again equal to the real value of government debt.

For (4.39) to define an equilibrium price level, it must hold that $ D_{t} \neq 0 . $ Niepelt
(2004) argued that the fiscal theory cannot hold if there is no initial outstanding stock of nominal government debt. However, Daniel (2007) showed that one can define non-Ricardian policies in a consistent manner when the initial stock of debt is zero. Her argument is most clearly seen in a two-period example. If the monetary author-ity pegs the nominal rate of interest, then any initial value of the price level is consistent with equilibrium, a standard result under interest rate pegs (see chapter 11 ). The nominal interest rate peg does pin down the expected inflation rate, or equivalently, the expected price level in the second period. However, this policy does not pin down the actual price level in period 2. Under a Ricardian fiscal policy, any realization of the price level in period $ 2, $ consistent with the value expected, is an equilibrium. If the realized price level were to result in the government's budget constraint not balancing, then the Ricardian nature of policy means that taxes and/or spending must adjust to ensure intertemporal budget balance at the realized price level. Under a non-Ricardian fiscal policy, only realizations of the price level that satisfy intertemporal budget balance can be consistent with an equilibrium. Thus, whatever quantity of nominal debt the government issued in the first period, the realized price level must ensure the real value of this debt in period 2 balances with the real value the government chooses for its primary surplus (including seigniorage). Under rational expectations, however, a non-Ricardian government cannot systematically employ price surprises in period 2 to finance spending because the monetary authority's interest peg has determined the expected value of the period 2 price level. Equilibrium must be consistent with those expectations.

An interest rate peg is just one possible specification for monetary policy. As an alternative, suppose as before that the fiscal authority sets the paths for $ g_{t+i} $ and $ \tau_{t+i}, $ but now suppose that the government adjusts tax revenues to offset any variations in seigniorage. In this case, $ \tau_{t+i}+\bar{s}_{t+i} $ becomes an exogenous process. Then (4.37) can be solved for the equilibrium price level independent of the nominal money stock. Equation (4.38) must still hold in equilibrium. If the monetary authority sets $ M_{t}, $ this equation determines the nominal interest rate that ensures that the real demand for money is equal to the real supply. If the monetary authority sets the nominal rate of interest, (4.38) determines the nominal money supply. The extreme implication of the fiscal theory (relative to traditional quantity theory results) is perhaps most stark when the monetary authority fixes the nominal supply of money: $ M_{t+i}=\bar{M} $ for all $ i \geq 0 . $ Then, under a fiscal policy that makes $ \tau_{t+i}+\bar{s}_{t+i} $ an exogenous process, the price level is proportional to $ D_{t} $ and, for a given level of $ D_{t}, $ is independent of the value chosen for $ \bar{M} $.

#### Empirical Evidence on the Fiscal 

Theory Under the fiscal theory of the price level, (4.37) holds at the equilibrium value of the price level. Under traditional theories of the price level, (4.37) holds for all values of the price level. If only equilibrium outcomes are observed, it will be impossible empirically to distinguish between the two theories. As Sims (1994,381) puts it, "Determinacy of the price level under any policy depends on the public's beliefs about what the policy authority would do under conditions that are never observed in equilibrium."

Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba (2001) examined VAR evidence on the response of U.S. liabilities to a positive innovation to the primary surplus. Under a nonRicardian policy, a positive innovation to $ \tau_{t}+\bar{s}_{t}-g_{t} $ should increase $ D_{t} / P_{t} $ (see (4.37)) unless it also signals future reductions in the surplus, that is, unless $ \tau_{t}+\bar{s}_{t}-g_{t} $ is negatively serially correlated. The authors argued that in a Ricardian regime, a positive innovation to the current primary surplus will reduce real liabilities. This can be seen by writing the budget constraint (4.34) in real terms as
$$
 d_{t+1}=R\left[d_{t}-\left(\tau_{t}+s_{t}-g_{t}\right)\right] \tag{4.40}
$$
Examining U.S. data, the authors found that the responses are inconsistent with a non-Ricardian regime. Increases in the surplus are associated with declines in current and future real liabilities, and the surplus does not display negative serial correlation. Cochrane pointed out the fundamental problem with this test: both (4.40) and (4.37) must hold in equilibrium, so it can be difficult to develop testable restrictions that can distinguish between the two regimes. The two regimes have different implications only if nonequilibrium values of the price level can be observed.

Bohn (1999) examined the U.S. deficit and debt processes and concluded that the primary surplus responds positively to the debt to GDP ratio. In other words, a rise in the debt to GDP ratio leads to an increase in the primary surplus. Thus, the surplus does adjust, and Bohn found that it responds enough to ensure that the intertemporal budget constraint is satisfied. This is evidence that the fiscal authority seems to act in a Ricardian fashion.

Finally, there is an older literature that attempted to estimate whether fiscal deficits tend to lead to faster money growth. Such evidence might be interpreted to imply a Ricardian regime of fiscal dominance. Some of this literature was reviewed in section 4.4

## 4.6 Optimal Taxation and Seigniorage

If the government can raise revenue by printing money, how much should it raise from this source? Suppose only distortionary revenue sources are available. To raise a given amount of revenue while causing the minimum deadweight loss from tax-induced distortions, **the government should generally set its tax instruments so that the marginal distortionary cost per dollar of revenue raised is equalized across all taxes**. As first noted by Phelps (1973), this suggests that an optimal tax package should include some seigniorage. This prescription links the optimal inflation tax to a more general problem of determining the optimal levels of all tax instruments. If governments are actually attempting to minimize the distortionary costs of raising revenue, then the optimal tax literature provides *a positive theory of inflation*.

According to this theory, there should be a positive correlation between tax rate and inflation. This is the case in the United States and Japan, but there is a negative correlation in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

Note that unanticipated inflation does not cause distortionary cost。

### Friedman’s Rule Revisited

The preceding analysis has gone partway toward integrating the choice of inflation with the general public finance choice of tax rates, and the discussion was motivated by Phelps’s conclusion that if only distortionary tax sources are available, some revenue should be raised from the inflation tax. However, this conclusion has been questioned by Kimbrough (1986a; 1986b); Faig (1988); Chari, Christiano, and Kehoe(1991; 1996); and Correia and Teles (1996; 1999).31 They showed that there are conditions under which Friedman’s rule for the optimal inflation rate—a zero nominal rate of interest—continues to be optimal even in the absence of lump-sum taxes. Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (1997) provided a general discussion of the conditions necessary for taxing (or not taxing) money.
