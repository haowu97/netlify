The course mainly teaches and discusses monetary and financial related theories, including **monetary demand and monetary supply theory**, the empirical evidence on money, price, output and interest rate; **monetary and public finance**, financial development and economic growth, developing countries' financial repression and financial deepening, the credit creation of the shadow bank, asset substitution and financial crisis, new monetary policy tool and monetary policy operation mode, financial risk and financial supervision, asset price bubble, financial crisis and macro-prudential policy, analysis of the cause of Chinese stock market bubble, and other more related theories and research.



**Monetary economics** investigates the relationship between real economic variables at the **aggregate level** (such as real output, real rates of interest, employment, and real exchange rates) and **nominal variables** (such as the inflation rate, nominal interest rates, nominal exchange rates, and the supply of money).

Monetary economics has considerable overlap with macroeconomics more generally, and these two fields have to a large degree shared a common history over most of the past 50 years.

- During the 1970s the monetarist/Keynesian debates led to a reintegration of monetary economics with macroeconomics.
- The seminal work of Robert Lucas (1972) provided theoretical foundations for
    models of economic fluctuations in which money was the fundamental driving factor behind movements in real output. 
- The rise of real-business-cycle models during the 1980s and early 1990s, building on the contribution of Kydland and Prescott (1982) and focusing explicitly on nonmonetary factors as the driving forces behind business cycles, tended to separate monetary economics from macroeconomics.
