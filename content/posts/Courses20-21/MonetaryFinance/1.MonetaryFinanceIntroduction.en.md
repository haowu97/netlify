**Monetary economics** investigates the relationship between real economic variables at the **aggregate level** (such as real output, real rates of interest, employment, and real exchange rates) and **nominal variables** (such as the inflation rate, nominal interest rates, nominal exchange rates, and the supply of money).

Monetary economics has considerable overlap with macroeconomics more generally, and these two fields have to a large degree shared a common history over most of the past 50 years.

- During the 1970s the monetarist/Keynesian debates led to a reintegration of monetary economics with macroeconomics.
- The seminal work of Robert Lucas (1972) provided theoretical foundations for
    models of economic fluctuations in which money was the fundamental driving factor behind movements in real output. 
- The rise of real-business-cycle models during the 1980s and early 1990s, building on the contribution of Kydland and Prescott (1982) and focusing explicitly on nonmonetary factors as the driving forces behind business cycles, tended to separate monetary economics from macroeconomics.

The course mainly teaches and discusses monetary and financial related theories, including **monetary demand and monetary supply theory**, the empirical evidence on money, price, output and interest rate; **monetary and public finance**, financial development and economic growth, developing countries' financial repression and financial deepening, the credit creation of the shadow bank, asset substitution and financial crisis, new monetary policy tool and monetary policy operation mode, financial risk and financial supervision, asset price bubble, financial crisis and macro-prudential policy, analysis of the cause of Chinese stock market bubble, and other more related theories and research.

## Some Basic Correlations

Monetary economics focuses on the behavior of prices, monetary aggregates, nominal and real interest rates, and output, so a useful starting point is to summarize briefly what macroeconomic data tell us about the relationships among these variables.

### Long-Run Relationships

McCandless and Weber (1995) examined data covering a 30-year period from 110 countries using several definitions of money.

- **the correlation between inflation and the growth rate of the money supply is almost 1**, varying between 0:92 and 0:96, depending on the definition of the money supply used.
-  there is **no correlation between either inflation or money growth and the growth rate of real output**. 
    - This conclusion is not as robust as the money growth–inflation one; diversity of empirical findings concerning the long-run relationship between inflation and real growth
    -  the general consensus is well summarized by the proposition, ‘‘about which there is now little disagreement,... that there is no long-run trade-off between the rate of inflation and the rate of unemployment’’ (Taylor 1996, 186).

Monnet and Weber (2001) examined annual average interest rates and
money growth rates over the period 1961–1998 for a sample of 31 countries. They found **a correlation of 0.87 between money growth and long-term interest rates.** For developed countries, the correlation is somewhat smaller (0.70); for developing countries, it is 0.84, although this falls to 0.66 when Venezuela is excluded. This evidence is consistent with the **Fisher equation**.

### Short-Run Relationships

Short-run correlations are likely to **vary across countries**, as different central banks implement policy in dfferent ways, and **across time** in a single country, as the sources of economic disturbances vary.

Some evidence on short-run correlations for the United States. 

The figures show correlations between the detrended log of real GDP and three different monetary aggregates, each also in detrended log form. **Trends are estimated using a Hodrick-Prescott filter**.

Data are quarterly from 1967:1 to 2008:2, and the figures plot, for the entire sample and for the subperiod 1984:1–2008:2, the correlation between real $ GDP_t $ and $ M_{t+j}$ against j, where M represents a monetary aggregate.

The post-1984 period is shown separately because 1984 often is identified as the beginning of a period characterized by greater macro-economic stability, at least until the onset of the financial crisis in 2007.

The three monetary aggregates are the monetary base (sometimes denoted M0), M1, and M2. 

- M0 is a narrow definition of the money supply, consisting of total reserves held by the banking system plus currency in the hands of the public. 
- M1 consists of currency held by the nonbank public, travelers checks, demand deposits, and other checkable deposits. 
- M2 consists of M1 plus savings accounts and small-denomination time deposits plus balances in retail money market mutual funds.

The larger correlations between GDP and M2 arise in part from the endogenous nature of an aggregate such as M2, depending as it does on banking sector behavior as well as on that of the nonbank private sector (see King and Plosser 1984; Coleman 1996). 

Cross-correlations between detrended real GDP and several interest rates and between detrended real GDP and the detrended GDP deflator.

For the entire sample period (figure 1.3), low interest rates tend to lead output, and a rise in output tends to be followed by higher interest rates. This pattern is less pronounced in the 1984:1–2008:2 period (figure 1.4), and interest rates appear to rise prior to an increase in detrended GDP.

In contrast, the GDP deflator tends to be below trend when output is above trend, but increases in real output tend to be followed by increases in prices, though this effect is absent in the more recent period. 

Kydland and Prescott (1990) argued that the negative contemporaneous correlation between the output and price series suggests that **supply shocks, not demand shocks, must be responsible for business cycle fluctuations**. 

The consensus from the empirical literature on the short-run effects of money is that exogenous monetary policy shocks produce **hump-shaped movements** in real economic activity. The peak effects occur after a lag of several quarters (as much as two or three years in some of the estimates) and then die out. 

Figure 1.5 shows several longer-term market rates of interest for the United States. As the figure suggests, 

- interest rates do tend to display similar behavior, although the 3-month Treasury bill rate, the shortest maturity shown, is more volatile than the other rates. 
- There are periods, however, when rates at different maturities and riskiness move in opposite directions. For example, during 2008, a period of financial crisis, the rate on corporate bonds rose while the rates on government debt, both at 3-month and 10-year maturities, were falling.

## Estimating the Effect of Money on Output

The exact manner in which policy is measured makes a difference, and using an incorrect measure of monetary policy can significantly affect the empirical estimates one obtains.

- Granger Causality
- Vector autoregression (VAR)
