## Law of One Price

The **law of one price** simply says that the *same* good in different competitive markets must sell for the same price in terms of the
same currency, when *transportation costs* and *barriers* between those markets are not important.

**Condition**: competitive markets free of

1. transportation costs
2. official barriers to trade (such as tariffs)

The law of one price says that the price of the same pizza (in a common currency) in the two cities must be the same if markets are competitive and transportation costs and barriers between markets are not important.

$$
P^{pizza}_{US} = (E_{USD/AUD}) \times (P^{pizza}_{AUS})
$$

where

- $P^{pizza}_{US} = \text{price of pizza in New York}$
- $P^{pizza}_{AUS} = \text{price of pizza in Sydney}$
- $E_{USD/AUD} = \text{U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange rate}$

## Purchasing power parity

**Purchasing power parity** is the application of the law of one price across countries for *all* goods and services, or for representative groups (“baskets”) of goods and services. 

$$
P_{US} = (E_{USD/AUD}) \times (P_{AUS})
$$

where

- P~US~ = level of average prices in the U.S.
- P~AUS~ = level of average prices in Australia
- $E_{USD/AUD} = \text{U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange rate}$

Purchasing power parity (PPP) implies that **the exchange rate is determined by levels of average prices**

$$
E_{USD/AUD}= P_{US}/P_{AUS}
$$

**Absolute PPP**: purchasing power parity that has already been discussed. Exchange rates equal the level of relative average prices across countries.

$$
E_{\$ / \epsilon}=P_{U S} / P_{\mathrm{EU}}
$$

**Relative PPP**: % changes in exchange rates equal the difference in the % changes in prices (inflation rate) in the two countries:

$$
\left(E_{\$ / \epsilon, t}-E_{\$ / \epsilon, t-1}\right) / E_{\$ / \epsilon, t-1}=\pi_{U S, t}-\pi_{E U, t}
$$

where $ \pi_{t}= $ inflation rate from period $ t-1 $ to $ t $.

The relative purchasing power parity states:

1. If the rate of inflation at home is higher than abroad, than the exchange rate will raise and the currency will depreciate.
2. If the rate of inflation at home is lower than abroad, than the exchange rate will fall and the currency will appreciate.

## Monetary Approach to Exchange Rates

**Monetary approach to the exchange rate**: uses monetary factors to predict how exchange rates adjust in the long run, based on the absolute version of PPP.

It predicts that levels of average prices across countries adjust so that the quantity of real monetary assets supplied will equal the quantity of real monetary assets demanded:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{\mathrm{US}}=M^{s}{ }_{\mathrm{US}} / L\left(R_{\$}, Y_{\mathrm{US}}\right) \\
 P_{\mathrm{EU}}=M_{\mathrm{EU}}^{s} / L\left(R_{\epsilon}, Y_{\mathrm{EU}}\right) 
\end{aligned}
$$

To the degree that PPP holds and to the degree that prices adjust to equate the quantity of real monetary assets supplied with the quantity of real monetary assets demanded, we have the following prediction: 

*The exchange rate is determined in the long run by prices, which are determined by the relative supply and demand of real monetary assets in money markets across countries*. 

$$
E_{\$ / \epsilon}=P_{U S} / P_{\mathrm{EU}} = \frac{M^{s}{ }_{\mathrm{US}} / L\left(R_{\$}, Y_{\mathrm{US}}\right)}{M_{\mathrm{EU}}^{s} / L\left(R_{\epsilon}, Y_{\mathrm{EU}}\right) }
$$
