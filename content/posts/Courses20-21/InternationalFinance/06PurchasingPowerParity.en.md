In the long run models, because prices are allowed to change, they will influence interest rates and exchange rates.

## Law of One Price

The **law of one price** simply says that the *same* good in different competitive markets must sell for the same price in terms of the
same currency, when *transportation costs* and *barriers* between those markets are not important.

**Condition**: competitive markets free of

1. transportation costs
2. official barriers to trade (such as tariffs)

The law of one price says that the price of the same pizza (in a common currency) in the two cities must be the same if markets are competitive and transportation costs and barriers between markets are not important.

$$
P^{pizza}_{US} = (E_{USD/AUD}) \times (P^{pizza}_{AUS})
$$

where

- $P^{pizza}_{US} = \text{price of pizza in New York}$
- $P^{pizza}_{AUS} = \text{price of pizza in Sydney}$
- $E_{USD/AUD} = \text{U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange rate}$

## Purchasing power parity

**Purchasing power parity** is the application of the law of one price across countries for *all* goods and services, or for representative groups (“baskets”) of goods and services. 
$$
P_{US} = (E_{USD/AUD}) \times (P_{AUS})
$$

where

- P~US~ = level of average prices in the U.S.
- P~AUS~ = level of average prices in Australia
- $E_{USD/AUD} = \text{U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange rate}$

Purchasing power parity (PPP) implies that **the exchange rate is determined by levels of average prices**

$$
E_{USD/AUD}= P_{US}/P_{AUS}
$$

**Absolute PPP**: purchasing power parity that has already been discussed. Exchange rates equal the level of relative average prices across countries.

$$
E_{\$ / \epsilon}=P_{U S} / P_{\mathrm{EU}}
$$

**Relative PPP**: % changes in exchange rates equal the difference in the % changes in prices (inflation rate) in the two countries:

$$
\left(E_{\$ / \epsilon, t}-E_{\$ / \epsilon, t-1}\right) / E_{\$ / \epsilon, t-1}=\pi_{U S, t}-\pi_{E U, t}
$$

where $ \pi_{t}= (P_t-P_{t-1})/P_{t-1}$ inflation rate from period $ t-1 $ to $ t $.

The relative purchasing power parity states:

1. If the rate of inflation at home is higher than abroad, than the exchange rate will raise and the currency will depreciate.
2. If the rate of inflation at home is lower than abroad, than the exchange rate will fall and the currency will appreciate.

## Monetary Approach to Exchange Rates

**Monetary approach to the exchange rate**: uses monetary factors to predict how exchange rates adjust in the long run, based on the absolute version of PPP.

It predicts that levels of average prices across countries adjust so that the quantity of real monetary assets supplied will equal the quantity of real monetary assets demanded:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{\mathrm{US}}=M^{s}{ }_{\mathrm{US}} / L\left(R_{\$}, Y_{\mathrm{US}}\right) \\
 P_{\mathrm{EU}}=M_{\mathrm{EU}}^{s} / L\left(R_{\epsilon}, Y_{\mathrm{EU}}\right) 
\end{aligned}
$$

To the degree that PPP holds and to the degree that prices adjust to equate the quantity of real monetary assets supplied with the quantity of real monetary assets demanded, we have the following prediction: 

*The exchange rate is determined in the long run by prices, which are determined by the relative supply and demand of real monetary assets in money markets across countries*. 

$$
E_{\$ / \epsilon}=P_{U S} / P_{\mathrm{EU}} = \frac{M^{s}{ }_{\mathrm{US}} / L\left(R_{\$}, Y_{\mathrm{US}}\right)}{M_{\mathrm{EU}}^{s} / L\left(R_{\epsilon}, Y_{\mathrm{EU}}\right) }
$$

The monetary approach makes a number of specific predictions about the long-run effects on the exchange rate of changes in money supplies, interest rates, and output levels:

1. *Money supply*: a permanent rise in the domestic money supply 
   1. causes a proportional increase in the domestic price level, 
   2. thus causing a proportional depreciation in the domestic currency (through PPP). 
   3. This is same prediction as long-run model without PPP.
2. *Interest rates*: a rise in domestic interest rates
   1. lowers the demand of real monetary assets,
   2. and is associated with a rise in domestic prices, 
   3. thus causing a proportional *depreciation* of the domestic currency (through PPP). 
3. *Output level*: a rise in the domestic level of production and income (output) 
   1. raises domestic demand of real monetary assets, 
   2. and is associated with a decreasing level of average domestic prices (for a fixed quantity of money supplied),
   3. thus causing a proportional appreciation of the domestic currency (through PPP).

All three changes cause prices to adjust so that the quantity of real monetary assets supplied matches the quantity of real monetary assets demanded, and cause exchange rates to adjust according to PPP.

### The Fisher Effect

A change in the money supply results in a change in the level of average prices.

A change in the *growth rate* of the money supply results in a change in the *growth rate* of prices (inflation).

- A constant growth rate in the money supply results in a persistent growth rate in prices (persistent inflation) at the same constant rate, when other factors are constant.
- Inflation does not affect the productive capacity of the economy and real income from production in the long run.
- Inflation, however, does affect nominal interest rates. How?

The *Fisher effect* (named affect Irving Fisher) describes the relationship between nominal interest rates and inflation.

- Derive the Fisher effect from the *interest parity condition*:

$$
R_{\$}-R_{\epsilon}=\left(E^{e}_{\$ / euro}-E_{\$ / euro}\right) / E_{\$ / \epsilon}
$$

- If financial markets expect *(relative) PPP* to hold, then expected exchange rate changes will equal expected inflation between countries: 

$$
\left(E_{\$/ \epsilon}^{e}-E_{\$ / \epsilon}\right) / E_{\$ / \epsilon}=\pi_{U S}^{e}-\pi_{E U}^{e} 
$$

- Hence,
  
$$
R_{\$}-R_{\epsilon}=\pi_{U S}^{e}-\pi_{E U}^{e}
$$

- The **Fisher effect**: a rise in the domestic inflation rate causes an equal rise in the interest rate on deposits of domestic currency in the long run, when other factors remain constant.

### Permanent Increase in the Growth Rate of Money Supply

Suppose that the U.S. central bank unexpectedly increases the growth rate of the money supply at time $ t_{0} $.

Suppose also that the inflation rate is $ \pi $​ in the US before $ t_{0} $​ and
$ \pi+\Delta \pi $​ after this time, but that the European inflation rate remains at $ 0 \% $​.

According to the *Fisher effect*, the interest rate in the U.S. will adjust to the higher inflation rate.

The *increase in nominal interest rates* decreases the demand of real monetary assets.

In order for the money market to maintain equilibrium in the long run, *prices must jump* so that

$$
P_{\mathrm{US}}=M_{\mathrm{US}}^{\mathrm{S}} / L\left(R_{\$}, Y_{\mathrm{US}}\right)
$$

In order to maintain PPP, the *exchange rate must jump* (the dollar must depreciate) so that

$$
E_{\$ / \epsilon}=P_{\mathrm{US}} / P_{\mathrm{EU}}
$$

Thereafter, the money supply and prices are predicted to grow at rate $ \pi+ \Delta \pi $ and the domestic currency is predicted to depreciate at the same rate.

*Figure*: Long-Run Time Paths of U.S. Economic Variables After a **Permanent Increase in the Growth Rate of the U.S. Money Supply**

- After the money supply growth rate increases at time $t_0$​ in panel (a), the interest rate (in panel (b)), price level (in panel (c)), and exchange rate (in panel (d)) move to new long-run equilibrium paths.
- (The money supply, price level, and exchange rate are all measured on a natural **logarithmic scale**, which makes variables that change at constant proportional rates appear as straight lines when they are graphed against time. The slope of the line equals the variable’s proportional growth rate.)

Previously: Increase in $R_\$$ leads to dollar appreciation (based on UIP or assets approach), NOT depreciation.

How can we reconcile the difference? Answer:

- In the previous topic, the increase in $R_\$$ is caused by a (one-time) *decrease* in the *level* of $M^S_{US}$; here, it is caused by an *increase* in the *rate of growth* of $M^S_{US}$
- There, assume the short run, where *prices are sticky* (so nominal rate has to adjust to clear money market) --- here assume the long run, where *prices are flexible and can adjust immediately*. 

Conclusion: To understand the relationship between changes in $R$​ and $E$​ (the exchange rate), it’s important to know *what factor causes the change in R and what is the time horizon* (short run vs. long run). 

## Shortcomings of PPP

There is, however, little empirical support for absolute purchasing power parity.

- The prices of identical commodity baskets, when converted to a single currency, differ substantially across countries.

Relative PPP is more consistent with data, but it also performs poorly to predict exchange rates.

*Figure*: The Yen/Dollar Exchange Rate and Relative Japan-U.S. Price Levels, 1980-2009

- The graph shows that relative PPP does not explain the yen/dollar exchange rate during 1980–2009.

Reasons why PPP may not be accurate: the law of one price may not hold because of 

1. Trade barriers and nontradable products 
2. Imperfect competition
3. Differences in measures of average prices for baskets of goods and services

**Trade barriers and nontradable products**

- Transport costs and governmental trade restrictions make trade expensive and in some cases create nontradable goods or services.
- *Services are often not tradable*: services are generally offered within a limited geographic region (for example, haircuts). 
- The greater the transport costs, the greater the range over which the exchange rate can deviate from its PPP value.
- One price need not hold in two markets.

**Imperfect competition** may result in *price discrimination*: “pricing to market.” 

- A firm sells the same product for different prices in different markets to maximize profits, based on expectations about what consumers are willing to pay.
- One price need not hold in two markets.

**Differences in the measure of average prices for goods and services**

- levels of average prices differ across countries because of differences in *how representative groups (“baskets”) of goods and services are measured*.
- Because measures of groups of goods and services are different, the measure of their average prices need not be the same.
- One price need not hold in two markets.
