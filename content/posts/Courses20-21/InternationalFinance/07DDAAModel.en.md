- Long-run models are useful when all prices of inputs and outputs have time to adjust.
- In the short run, some prices of inputs and outputs may not have time to adjust, due to labor contracts, costs of adjustment, or imperfect information about willingness of customers to pay at different prices.
- This chapter builds on the short-run and long-run models of exchange rates to explain how output is related to exchange rates in the short run.
    - It shows how macroeconomic policies can affect production, employment, and the current account.

## 1. Real exchange rate and aggregate demand

**Aggregate demand** is the aggregate amount of goods and services that individuals and institutions are willing to buy:

- consumption expenditure (C)
- investment expenditure (I)
- government purchases (G)
- net expenditure by foreigners: the current account (CA)

For now, we assume taxes T, investment demand I and government purchases G are all fixed (i.e. exogenous factors). 

Determinants of **consumption expenditure** include:

- Disposable income: income from production (Y) minus taxes (T). 
- More disposable income means more consumption expenditure, but consumption typically increases less than the amount that disposable income increases.
- Real interest rates may influence the amount of saving and spending on consumption goods, but we assume that they are relatively unimportant here.
- Wealth may also influence consumption expenditure, but we assume that it is relatively unimportant here.

*Consumption expenditure is modeled as a function of disposable income: C(Y-T)* 

Determinants of the **current account** include:

- Real exchange rate: prices of foreign products (P*) relative to the prices of domestic products (P), both measured in domestic currency:
    - As the prices of foreign products rise relative to those of domestic products, expenditure on domestic products rises, and expenditure on foreign products falls.
- Disposable income: more disposable income means more expenditure on foreign products (imports).

*Current account is modeled as a function of real exchange rate and disposable income*:  CA(Y - T, $\frac{EP^*}{P}$) 

Assume that a real depreciation leads to an increase in the current account: the volume effect (import decreases) dominates the value effect (import value increases due to the higher real exchange rate).

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/2021/RealCA.png)



Aggregate demand is therefore expressed as:
$$
D=C(Y-T)+I+G+C A\left(\frac{E P^{*}}{P}, Y-T\right)
$$
where $ C, C A, Y, T, I, G $ and $ E P^{*} / P $ are defined the same as in the previous slides.

Or more simply:
$$
D=D\left(\frac{E P^{*}}{P}, Y-T, I, G\right)
$$
Note $ T, I $ and $ G $ are exogenous.

If all other factors remain unchanged, a rise in output (real income), *Y*, increases aggregate demand. Because the increase in aggregate demand is less than the increase in output, the slope of the aggregate demand function is less than 1 (as indicated by its position within the 45-degree angle).

Real exchange rate: an increase in the real exchange rate increases the current account, and therefore increases aggregate demand of domestic products. 

Disposable income: an increase in the disposable income increases consumption expenditure, but decreases the current account. 

- Since consumption expenditure is usually greater than expenditure on foreign products, the first effect dominates the second effect.
- As income increases for a given level of taxes, aggregate consumption expenditure and aggregate demand increase by less than income.

Equilibrium is achieved when the value of output and income from production Y equals the value of aggregate demand D

$$
Y=D\left(\frac{E P^{*}}{P}, Y-T, I, G\right)
$$

where aggregate demand is a function of the real exchange rate, disposable income, investment expenditure and government purchases.

In the short run, output settles ate Y1 (point 1), where aggregate demand, D1, equals aggregate output Y1.

## 2. Short-run equilibrium analysis (open economy)

### 2.1 DD schedule

How does the exchange rate affect the short-run equilibrium of aggregate demand and output?

- With fixed domestic and foreign levels of average prices, a rise in the nominal exchange rate makes foreign goods and services more expensive relative to domestic goods and services. (note in the short-run, P remains unchanged) 
- A rise in the nominal exchange rate (a domestic currency depreciation) increases aggregate demand of domestic products.
- In equilibrium, production will increase to match the higher aggregate demand.
- The DD schedule displays the trajectory of the changes in the equilibrium aggregate demand driven by the changes in the nominal exchange rate. 

The DD schedule: 

- shows combinations of output and the exchange rate at which the output market is in short-run equilibrium (such that aggregate demand = aggregate output).
- slopes upward because a rise in the exchange rate from E1 to E2 all else equal, causes output to rise from Y1 to Y2.

Shifting the DD curve

Changes in the exchange rate cause movements along a DD curve. Other changes cause it to shift:

- Changes in G: more government purchases cause higher aggregate demand and output in equilibrium. Output increases for every exchange rate: the DD curve shifts right.
- Changes in T: lower taxes generally increase consumption expenditure, increasing aggregate demand and output in equilibrium for every exchange rate: the DD curve shifts right.
- Changes in I: higher investment expenditure is represented by shifting the DD curve right.
- Changes in P relative to P*: lower domestic prices relative to foreign prices are represented by shifting the DD curve right.
- Changes in C: willingness to consume more and save less is represented by shifting the DD curve right.
- Changes in demand of domestic goods relative to foreign goods: willingness to consume more domestic goods relative to foreign goods is represented by shifting the DD curve right.

### 2.2 AA schedule

The DD schedule shows the exchange rate and output levels that set **output market** in equilibrium in the short-run.  

Equilibrium in the economy as a whole requires equilibrium in the **asset market** (i.e. exchange market and money market) as well.

The schedule of exchange rate and output combinations that are consistent with equilibrium in domestic money market and the foreign exchange market is called the **AA schedule**.

- Foreign exchange markets: interest parity represents equilibrium:
- Money market 
    - Equilibrium occurs when the quantity of real monetary assets supplied matches the quantity of real monetary assets demanded:
    - A rise in income from production causes the demand of real monetary assets to increase (notice the downward shift of the L(R, Y) curve in the lower part of the graph).

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/2021/DerivingAAcurve.png)

When income and production increase, 

- demand of real monetary assets increases, 
- leading to an increase in domestic interest rates,
- leading to an appreciation of the domestic currency.
- Recall that an appreciation of the domestic currency is represented by a fall in E.

The inverse relationship between output and exchange rates needed to keep the foreign exchange markets and the money market in equilibrium is summarized as the AA curve.

![image-20211125232451273](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/2021/AAcurve.png)

Shifting the AA curve

- Changes in Ms: an increase in the money supply reduces interest rates in the short run, causing the domestic currency to depreciate (a rise in E) for every Y: the AA curve shifts up (right).
- Changes in P: An increase in the level of average domestic prices decreases the supply of real monetary assets, increasing interest rates, causing the domestic currency to appreciate (a fall in E): the AA curve shifts down (left).
- Changes in the demand of real monetary assets: if domestic residents are willing to hold a lower amount of real money assets and more non-monetary assets, interest rates on nonmonetary assets would fall, leading to a depreciation of the domestic currency (a rise in E): the AA curve shifts up (right).
- Changes in R* : An increase in the foreign interest rates makes foreign currency deposits more attractive, leading to a depreciation of the domestic currency (a rise in E): the AA curve shifts up (right).
- Changes in Ee : if market participants expect the domestic currency to depreciate in the future, foreign currency deposits become more attractive, causing the domestic currency to depreciate (a rise in E): the AA curve shifts up (right).

### 2.3 Putting the DD and AA curves together

A short-run equilibrium means a nominal exchange rate and level of output such that

- equilibrium in the output markets holds: aggregate demand equals aggregate output.
- equilibrium in the foreign exchange markets holds: interest parity holds.
- equilibrium in the money market holds: the quantity of real monetary assets supplied equals the quantity of real monetary assets demanded.

A short-run equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the DD and AA curves:

- output markets are in equilibrium on the DD curve
- asset markets are in equilibrium on the AA curve

The short-run equilibrium of the economy occurs at point 1, where the output market (whose equilibrium points are summarized by the DD curve) and the asset market (whose equilibrium points are summarized by the AA curve) simultaneously clear.

![image-20211125232842563](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/2021/DDAAmodel.png)

Imagine the economy is instead at point 2, where both the output and asset markets are out of equilibrium. 

Because asset markets adjust very quickly, the exchange rate jumps immediately from point 2 to point 3 on AA*. The economy then moves to point 1 along AA as output rises to meet aggregate demand**.

## 3. Temporary changes in monetary and fiscal policy

### 3.1 Temporary changes in monetary policy

An increase in the quantity of monetary assets supplied lowers interest rates in the short run, causing the domestic currency to depreciate (E rises).

- The AA shifts up (right).
- Domestic products relative to foreign products are cheaper, so that aggregate demand and output increase until a new short-run equilibrium is achieved.

By shifting AA1 upward, *a temporary increase in the money supply causes a currency depreciation and a rise in output*.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/2021/MonetaryPolicyDDAA.png)

### 3.2 Temporary changes in fiscal policy

An increase in government purchases or a decrease in taxes increases aggregate demand and output in the short run.

- The DD curve shifts right.
- Higher output increases the demand for real monetary assets, 
    - thereby increasing interest rates,
    - causing the domestic currency to appreciate (E falls).

By shifting DD1 to the right, *a temporary fiscal expansion causes a currency appreciation and a rise in output*.

![image-20211125233450966](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/2021/FiscalPolicyDDAA.png)

### 3.3 Policies to maintain full employment

Resources used in the production process can either be over-employed or underemployed.

When resources are used effectively and sustainably, economists say that production is at its **potential or natural level**.

- When resources are not used effectively, resources are **underemployed**: high unemployment, few hours worked, idle equipment, lower than normal production of goods and services.
- When resources are not used sustainably, labor is **over-employed**: low unemployment, many overtime hours, over-utilized equipment, higher than normal production of goods and services.

3. Temporary changes in monetary and fiscal policy

A temporary fall in world demand shifts DD1 to DD2, reducing output from Yf to Y2 and causing the currency to depreciate from E1 to E2 (point 2). 

- Temporary fiscal expansion can restore full employment (point 1) by shifting the DD schedule back to its original position. 
- Temporary monetary expansion can restore full employment (point 3) by shifting AA1 to AA2. 
- The two policies differ in their exchange rate effects: The fiscal policy restores the currency to its previous value (E1), whereas the monetary policy causes the currency to depreciate further, to E3.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/2021/20211125233827.png)

After a temporary money demand increase (shown by the shift from AA1 to AA2), either an increase in the money supply or temporary fiscal expansion can be used to maintain full employment. 

The two policies have different exchange rate effects: The monetary policy restores the exchange rate back to E1, whereas the fiscal policy leads to greater appreciation (E3).

![image-20211125234019905](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/2021/20211125234022.png)

Policies to maintain full employment may seem easy in theory, but are hard in practice.

1. We have assumed that prices and expectations do not change, but people may anticipate the effects of policy changes and modify their behavior.
    1. Workers may require higher wages if they expect overtime and easy employment, and producers may raise prices if they expect high wages and strong demand due to monetary and fiscal policies.
    2. Fiscal and monetary policies may therefore create price changes and inflation, thereby preventing high output and employment: inflationary bias. 
2. Economic data are difficult to measure and to understand. 
    1. Policy makers cannot interpret data about asset markets and aggregate demand with certainty, and sometimes they make mistakes.
3. Changes in policies take time to be implemented and to affect the economy.
    1. Because they are slow, policies may affect the economy after the effects of an economic change have dissipated.
4. Policies are sometimes influenced by political or bureaucratic interests.

## 4. Permanent changes in monetary and fiscal policy

### 4.1 Monetary policy

“Permanent” policy changes are those that are assumed to modify people’s expectations about exchange rates in the long run.

A permanent increase in the quantity of monetary assets supplied has several effects:

- It lowers interest rates in the short run and makes people expect future depreciation of the domestic currency, increasing the expected rate of return on foreign currency deposits. 
- The domestic currency depreciates (E rises) more than is the case when expectations are constant (overshooting). 
- The AA curve shifts up (right) more than is the case when expectations are held constant.

Short-run effects of a permanent increase in the money supply

- A permanent increase in the money supply, which shifts AA1 to AA2 and moves the economy from point 1 to point 2, has **stronger effects on the exchange rate and output than an equal temporary increase**, which moves the economy only to point 3.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/2021/20211125235147.png)

Long-run effects of a permanent increase in the money supply

- In the long-run, price is flexible and will sufficiently adjust to the changes in monetary policy (higher wages and output prices). 
- After a permanent money supply increase, a steadily **increasing price level** shifts the DD and AA schedules to the left until a new long-run equilibrium (point 3) is reached.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/2021/20211125235310.png)

### 4.2 Fiscal policy

A permanent increase in government purchases or reduction in taxes 

- increases aggregate demand
- makes people expect the domestic currency to appreciate in the short run due to increased aggregate demand, thereby reducing the expected rate of return on foreign currency deposits and making the domestic currency appreciate.

The first effect increases aggregate demand of domestic products, the second effect decreases aggregate demand of domestic products (by making them more expensive).

Effects of a permanent fiscal expansion

- If the change in fiscal policy is expected to be permanent, the first and second effects exactly offset each other, so that output remains at its potential or natural (or long run) level.
- We say that an increase in government purchases completely crowds out net exports, due to the effect of the appreciated domestic currency.
- Because **a permanent fiscal expansion changes exchange rate expectations**, it shifts AA1 leftward as it shifts DD1 to the right. The effect on output (point 2) is nil if the economy starts in long-run equilibrium. A comparable temporary fiscal expansion, in contrast, would leave the economy at point 3.

## 5. Macroeconomic policies and current account: XX curve

### 5.1 XX curve

Derive the XX curve to represent the combinations of output and exchange rates at which the current account is at its desired level. 

As income from production increases, imports increase and the current account decreases when other factors remain constant.

To **keep the current account at its desired level**, the domestic currency must depreciate as income from production increases: *the XX curve should slope upward*.

Along the curve XX, **the current account is constant at the level CA = X**. 

- Monetary expansion moves the economy to point 2 and thus raises the current account balance. Temporary fiscal expansion moves the economy to point 3, while permanent 
- fiscal expansion moves it to point 4; in either case, the current account balance falls.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/2021/XXcurve.png)

The XX curve slopes upward but is flatter than the DD curve.

- DD represents equilibrium values of aggregate demand and domestic output.
- As domestic income and production increase, domestic saving increases, which means that aggregate demand (willingness to spend) by domestic residents does not rise as rapidly as income and production.

As domestic income and production increase, the domestic currency must depreciate to entice foreigners to increase their demand of domestic products in order to keep the current account (only one component of aggregate demand) at its desired level—on the XX curve.

As domestic income and production increase, the domestic currency must depreciate **more rapidly** to entice foreigners to increase their demand of domestic products in order to keep aggregate demand (by domestic residents and foreigners) equal to production—on the DD curve.

Policies affect the current account through their influence on the value of the domestic currency.

- An increase in the quantity of monetary assets supplied depreciates the domestic currency and often increases the current account in the short run.
- An increase in government purchases or decrease in taxes appreciates the domestic currency and often decreases the current account in the short run.

### 5.2 The J-curve

If *the volume of imports and exports is fixed in the short run*, a depreciation of the domestic currency 

- will not affect the volume of imports or exports, 
- but will increase the value/price of imports in domestic currency and decrease the current account:
- The value of exports in domestic currency does not change.

The current account could immediately decrease after a currency depreciation, then increase gradually as the volume effect begins to dominate the value effect. (Check the J-curve on the next slide). 

The J-curve describes the time lag with which a real currency depreciation improves the current account.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/2021/Jcurve.png)

### 5.3 Pass-through

**Pass-through** from the exchange rate to import prices measures the percentage by which import prices change when the value of the domestic currency changes by 1%.

- In the DD-AA model, the pass-through rate is 100%: import prices in domestic currency exactly match a depreciation of the domestic currency.
- In reality, pass-through may be less than 100% due to price discrimination in different countries. 
    - Firms that set prices may decide not to match changes in the exchange rate with changes in prices of foreign products denominated in domestic currency.

–	If prices of foreign products in domestic currency do not change much because of a pass-through rate less than 100%, then 
–	the value of imports will not rise much after a domestic currency depreciation, and the current account will not fall much, making the J-curve effect smaller.
–	the volume of imports and exports will not adjust much over time, since domestic currency prices do not change much. 
–	Pass-through of less than 100% dampens the effect of depreciation or appreciation on the current account.

### A low-output liquidity trap

At point 1, output is below its full employment level. Because exchange rate expectations Ee are fixed, however, a monetary expansion will merely shift AA to the right, leaving the initial equilibrium point the same. The horizontal stretch of AA gives rise to the liquidity trap.

## 6. Economic growth and stock markets

Is there a relationship between economic growth and equity market returns?

My favorite analogy for stocks vs the economy：“…the dog’s going walk in the general direction that the woman walks the dog. So the economy and the dog – or the economy the stock market are somewhat connected. But they do not look the same. They do not act the same even if they’re walking in the same direction.”

Stock market has almost always ignored the economy

- The correlation between the market and the economy is -0.04 over the rolling 10 year period. 
- The U.S. stock market and the economy often diverge for long periods. 
- The S&P500 recorded around 16% increase in 2020 while the GDP of the US declined by 2.3%. 

How are economics growth and stock markets related? Stock market development may influence the economy through (levine and Zervos 1996):

- Liquidity: many high-return projects require a long-run commitment of capital but investors are generally reluctant to relinquish control of their savings for long period.  
- Risk diversification: diversification through internationally integrated stock markets encourages investment in projects with higher returns (or higher diversifiable risk). 
- Acquisition of information and corporate control: stock markets stimulate investors to research and monitor firms whereby improving resource allocation and spurring economic growth. 

Empirical evidence (levine and Zervos 1996): stock market development is positively correlated with the long-run economic growth based on a sample of 41 countries during the period from 1976 to 1993. 

There is no evidence supporting that the economic growth is a good predictor of stock market returns. There are many factors distorting the correlation between stock market returns and the economic growth. 

- Economic growth does result in a higher standard of living for consumers, but it does not necessarily translate into a higher present value of dividends per share for the owners of the existing capital stock. 
- The expected economic growth is already impounded into the prices, thus lowering future returns. 
- The aggregate earnings of an economy and the growth in earnings per share to which current investors have a claim do not necessarily match, since there are factors that can dilute aggregate earnings (e.g. IPOs and SEOs). 
- Please refer to Ritter (2005) for more discussions on the relation between the economic growth and stock market returns. Real returns seem unrelated to GDP growth, and statistically, the correlation is -0.27 for 1900–2000 and -0.03 for 1951–2000.
