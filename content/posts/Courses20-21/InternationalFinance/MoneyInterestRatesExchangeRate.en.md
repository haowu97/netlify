## Money Defined: A Brief Review

**Money** is an asset that is widely used as a means of payment.

Different groups of assets may be classified as money.

- Money can be defined narrowly or broadly.
- Currency in circulation, checking deposits, and debit card accounts form a narrow definition of money (**M1**).
- Deposits of currency (e.g. term deposits) are excluded from this narrow definition, although they may act as a substitute for money in a broader definition (**M2**).

Three **functions of money** (why we demand/hold money):

1. as a *medium of exchange*, i.e. a universally accepted means of payments; this is arguably the most important function of money (implies that money is a *highly liquid asset*)
2. as a *unit of account*, i.e. a widely recognized measure of value
3. as a *store of value*, i.e. as a means of transferring purchasing power from the present into the future (an asset)

liquid v.s. Illiquid asset

- Money is a *liquid asset*: it can be easily used to pay for goods and services or to repay debt without substantial transaction costs. 
    - But monetary or liquid assets earn *little or no interest*.
- *Illiquid* assets require substantial transaction costs in terms of time, effort, or fees to convert them to funds for payment. 
    - But they generally earn a higher interest rate or rate of return than monetary assets.

The interest rate is thus *the opportunity cost of holding money*.



**Money Supply**

The central bank controls the quantity of money that circulates in an economy, the **money supply**.

- In *Australia*, it is controlled by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).
    - The RBA directly regulates the amount of currency in circulation.
    - It indirectly influences the amount of checking deposits, debit card accounts, and other monetary assets. 



**Money Demand**

**Money demand** represents the amount of monetary assets that people are willing to hold (instead of illiquid assets).



**Three main factors** determine *aggregate (nominal) money demand*:

1. **Interest rates/expected rates of return**: monetary assets pay little or no interest, so the interest rate on non-monetary assets like bonds, loans, and deposits is the opportunity cost of holding monetary assets.
    1. A higher interest rate means a higher opportunity cost of holding monetary assets → lower demand of money.
2. **Prices**: the prices of goods and services bought in transactions will influence the willingness to hold money to conduct those transactions. 
    1. A higher level of average prices means a greater need for liquidity to buy the same amount of goods and services → higher demand of money.
3. **Income**: greater income implies more goods and services can be bought, so that more money is needed to conduct transactions.
    1. A higher real national income (GNP) means more goods and services are being produced and bought in transactions, increasing the need for liquidity → higher demand of money.



The aggregate demand of money can be expressed as:
$$
M^d = P \times L(R,Y)
$$
where:

- P is the price level
- Y is real national income
- R is a measure of interest rates on non-monetary assets
- L(R,Y) is the aggregate demand of real monetary assets

Alternatively:
$$
M^d/P = L(R,Y)
$$
Aggregate demand of *real* monetary assets is a function of national income and interest rates.

The money market equilibrium



When no shortages (excess demand) or surpluses (excess supply) of monetary assets exist, we have an **equilibrium** in the money market:
$$
M^s = M^d
$$
**Alternatively**, the equilibrium in the money market occurs when the quantity of real monetary assets supplied matches the quantity of real monetary assets demanded, 
$$
M^s/P = L(R,Y)
$$
The *equilibrium interest rate* is the rate under which $M^s = M^d$​.

Changes in the Domestic Money Supply

1. An *increase* in a country’s money supply causes interest rates to fall, rates of return on domestic currency deposits to fall, and the domestic currency to depreciate.
2. A *decrease* in a country’s money supply causes interest rates to rise, rates of return on domestic currency deposits to rise, and the domestic currency to appreciate.

Changes in the Foreign Money Supply

How would a change in the supply of euros affect the U.S. money market and foreign exchange markets?

1. An increase in the supply of euros causes a depreciation of the euro (an appreciation of the dollar).
2. A decrease in the supply of euros causes an appreciation of the euro (a depreciation of the dollar).
