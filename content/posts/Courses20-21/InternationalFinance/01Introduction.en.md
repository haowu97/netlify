International economy can be divided into two broad subfields:

1. **international trade**: International trade focuses on the *real transactions* in the international economy
2. **international finance**: International finance focuses on *the monetary side* of the international economy

The importance of international economics has never been as important as it is now!

- Globalization: 
    - Both imports and exports have risen as a share of the U.S. economy, but imports have risen more.
        - US imports have been outweighing exports since 1980s.
    - Both imports and exports have increased significantly after the second WW.
    - Both imports and exports have decreased during recessions!
- Trade/ currency wars
- Financial crises

There are several **themes** in international economics:

- The **gains from trade**: Export goods that require locally abundant resources and import goods whose resources are locally scarce.
- The **pattern of trade**: Relative supplies of national resources vs. the relative use of these resources in the production of different goods
    - Ex: BC is a leading exporter of wood products; the main imported goods include automobiles and petroleum oils
- **Quantity of trade**: How much to trade? Protectionism vs. Free Trade
- **Balance of payments**: Trade surplus vs. Trade deficit

    - Ex: China has been running trade surpluses for years whereas the US has constantly run trade deficits since 1982.
- **Exchange rate determination**: Depreciation makes exports cheaper but imports more expensive
- **International policy coordination**: EU (European Union), NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement), GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)
- **International capital market**: Investment on foreign assets/subsidiaries
    - Ex: Japan's investment on the US subsidiaries in 1980s.
