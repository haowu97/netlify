*Exchange rates*: The price of one nation’s currency in terms of another currency. 

- *Base currency* per *Quote currency*, the number of Base currency needed to buy 1 Quote currency.

**Textbook notation**: 

`AUD1.5/USD` or `AUD1.5 = USD 1`

- the number of AUD needed to buy 1 USD, or number of AUD you can buy with 1USD
- you need 1.5 AUD to buy 1 USD, or you can buy 1.5AUD with 1 USD

`¥93.17/A$` or `A$0.0107/¥`: 

- How much can be exchanged for one dollar? ¥93.17/A$
- How much can be exchanged for one yen? A$0.0107/ ¥

However, **industry notation**:

- USD/AUD → number of AUD needed to buy 1USD
- … yes, it can get confusing

Exchange Rate Quotes

- *Direct quote*: units of domestic currency per unit of foreign currency; quoting domestic currency first (in the numerator)
- *Indirect quote*: units of foreign currency per unit of domestic currency; quoting foreign currency first (in the numerator)

$$
Indirect = \frac{1}{Direct}
$$

Exchange Rate Changes

*Appreciation/ depreciation*: value of a currency increases/decreases in terms of another currency, driven by market forces, e.g. in free float systems.

*Revaluation/ devaluation*: value of a currency is changed by the government, e.g. in fixed rate systems

A depreciated currency is less valuable, and therefore it can buy fewer foreign-produced goods that are denominated in foreign currency.

- A Honda costs `¥2,500,000 x $0.0107/¥ = $26,750`
- Less expensive than `$30,000 at $0.0120/¥`

A depreciated currency means that imports are more expensive and domestically-produced goods and exports are less expensive. 

**A depreciated currency lowers the price of exports relative to the price of imports** (OR: raises the price of imports relative to the price exports).

The reverse holds under an appreciated currency.



Calculating exchange rate changes

If the Thai baht fell 17% against the US dollar, by how much has the USD appreciated against the baht?

Amount of currency appreciation/depreciation = (New value - Old value) / Old value 

Let $ e_{1}=\mathrm{USD} / \mathrm{THB} $, then $ \mathrm{THB} / \mathrm{USD}=1 / e_{1} $

Change in USD/THB is
$$
\left(e_{1}-e_{0}\right) / e_{0}=-17 \% \rightarrow e_{1}=-0.17 e_{0}+e_{0}=0.83 e_{0} 
$$
Change in THB/USD is
$$
\left(1 / e_{1}-1 / e_{0}\right) /\left(1 / e_{0}\right)=\left(e_{0}-e_{1}\right) / e_{1} 
\rightarrow \left(e_{0}-0.83 e_{0}\right) / 0.83 e_{0}=0.17 e_{0} / 0.83 e_{0}=0.2048
$$
The USD appreciated $ 20.48 \% $ relative to the Thai baht

Note: Change in USD/THB $\neq$ change in THB/USD!



### Central Bank Reputations and Expectations

A nation’s official monetary authority, the *central bank* uses monetary policy to achieve price stability, set interest rates, or maintain a certain currency value.

Fiat money is no longer linked to an underlying asset, so 

- central banks play a crucial role in setting the risk associated with holding a currency.
- Risk depends on central bank’s ability to maintain price stability, target values, etc.
- Investors’ expectations of central bank behavior affect exchange rates

*Central bank independence*: avoid direct control by government officials that could use monetary policy for short-term political gains at the costs of long-term economic issues

- Non-independent central bank may be forced to monetize budget deficit by printing money to finance public sector spending
- E.g. Post WWI Germany, Zimbabwe

Independent central banks tend to have

- Lower inflation rates
- Higher economic growth

Example: New Zealand’s central bank was made independent in 1990: inflation dropped to 1.3% and cut government spending on welfare programs.

*Central Bank Interventions*: Official purchases or sales of currencies to influence local (domestic) currency.

*Unsterilized intervention*

- e.g. European Central Bank (ECB) wants to let USD/EUR depreciate → increase supply of EUR or increase demand for USD
- Buy USD in exchange for EUR (i.e. sell EUR for USD)
- However, EU money supply and therefore **inflation increases**

*Sterilized intervention*: **neutralize inflation**

- Open-market operations to keep money supply constant
- usually by buying or selling treasury securities
- e.g. ECB can reduce EUR supply by selling euro-denominated securities to public
- However, assumes public views euro-denominated securities as perfect substitutes for dollar-denominated securities, portfolio rebalancing can result in a null effect on exchange rates.
