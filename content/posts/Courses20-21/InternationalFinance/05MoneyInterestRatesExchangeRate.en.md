## Money Defined: A Brief Review

**Money** is an asset that is widely used as a means of payment.

Different groups of assets may be classified as money.

- Money can be defined narrowly or broadly.
- Currency in circulation, checking deposits, and debit card accounts form a narrow definition of money (**M1**).
- Deposits of currency (e.g. term deposits) are excluded from this narrow definition, although they may act as a substitute for money in a broader definition (**M2**).

Three **functions of money** (why we demand/hold money):

1. as a *medium of exchange*, i.e. a universally accepted means of payments; this is arguably the most important function of money (implies that money is a *highly liquid asset*)
2. as a *unit of account*, i.e. a widely recognized measure of value
3. as a *store of value*, i.e. as a means of transferring purchasing power from the present into the future (an asset)

liquid v.s. Illiquid asset

- Money is a *liquid asset*: it can be easily used to pay for goods and services or to repay debt without substantial transaction costs. 
    - But monetary or liquid assets earn *little or no interest*.
- *Illiquid* assets require substantial transaction costs in terms of time, effort, or fees to convert them to funds for payment. 
    - But they generally earn a higher interest rate or rate of return than monetary assets.

The interest rate is thus *the opportunity cost of holding money*.

## Money Supply & Demand

### Money Supply

The central bank controls the quantity of money that circulates in an economy, the **money supply**.

- In *Australia*, it is controlled by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).
    - The RBA directly regulates the amount of currency in circulation.
    - It indirectly influences the amount of checking deposits, debit card accounts, and other monetary assets. 

### Money Demand

**Money demand** represents the amount of monetary assets that people are willing to hold (instead of illiquid assets).

**Three main factors** determine *aggregate (nominal) money demand*:

1. **Interest rates/expected rates of return**: monetary assets pay little or no interest, so the interest rate on non-monetary assets like bonds, loans, and deposits is the opportunity cost of holding monetary assets.
    1. A higher interest rate means a higher opportunity cost of holding monetary assets → lower demand of money.
2. **Prices**: the prices of goods and services bought in transactions will influence the willingness to hold money to conduct those transactions. 
    1. A higher level of average prices means a greater need for liquidity to buy the same amount of goods and services → higher demand of money.
3. **Income**: greater income implies more goods and services can be bought, so that more money is needed to conduct transactions.
    1. A higher real national income (GNP) means more goods and services are being produced and bought in transactions, increasing the need for liquidity → higher demand of money.

The aggregate demand of money can be expressed as:
$$
M^d = P \times L(R,Y)
$$
where:

- P is the price level
- Y is real national income
- R is a measure of interest rates on non-monetary assets
- L(R,Y) is the aggregate demand of real monetary assets

Alternatively:
$$
M^d/P = L(R,Y)
$$
Aggregate demand of *real* monetary assets is a function of national income and interest rates.

## The money market equilibrium



When no shortages (excess demand) or surpluses (excess supply) of monetary assets exist, we have an **equilibrium** in the money market:
$$
M^s = M^d
$$
**Alternatively**, the equilibrium in the money market occurs when the quantity of real monetary assets supplied matches the quantity of real monetary assets demanded, 
$$
M^s/P = L(R,Y)
$$
The *equilibrium interest rate* is the rate under which $M^s = M^d$​.

## Money and the Exchange Rate in the Short Run

Figure: Simultaneous Equilibrium in the U.S. Money Market and the Foreign Exchange Market 

- Both asset markets are in equilibrium at the interest rate $ R_{\$}^{1} $​​ and exchange rate $ E_{\$ / \epsilon}^{1} ; $​​ at these values, *money supply equals money demand* (point 1) and the *interest parity condition* holds (point $ 1^{\prime}$​​).

### Changes in Domestic Money Supply

1. An *increase* in a country’s money supply causes interest rates to fall, rates of return on domestic currency deposits to fall, and the domestic currency to depreciate.
2. A *decrease* in a country’s money supply causes interest rates to rise, rates of return on domestic currency deposits to rise, and the domestic currency to appreciate.

### Changes in Foreign Money Supply

How would a change in the supply of euros affect the U.S. money market and foreign exchange markets?

1. An increase in the supply of euros causes a depreciation of the euro (an appreciation of the dollar).
    1. The increase in the supply of euros reduces interest rates in the EU, reducing the expected rate of return on euro deposits.
    2. This reduction in the expected rate of return on euro deposits causes the euro to depreciate.
    3. We predict no change in the U.S. money market due to the change in the supply of euros.
2. A decrease in the supply of euros causes an appreciation of the euro (a depreciation of the dollar).

## Money, the Price Level, and the Exchange Rate in the Long Run

In the *short run*, prices do not have sufficient time to adjust to market conditions --- we say that prices are “**rigid**” in the short run. 

- The analysis heretofore has been a short-run analysis. 

In the *long run*, prices of factors of production and of output have sufficient time to adjust to market conditions.

- Wages adjust to the demand and supply of labor.
- Real output and income are determined by the amount of workers and other factors of production—by the economy’s productive capacity—*not by the quantity of money supplied*. 

In the long run, the quantity of money supplied is predicted not to influence the amount of output, (real) interest rates, and the aggregate demand of real monetary assets $L(R,Y)$.

However, the quantity of money supplied is predicted to make the level of average prices *adjust proportionally* in the long run.

- The equilibrium condition $M^s/P = L(R,Y)$ shows that $P$ is predicted to adjust proportionally when $M^s$ adjusts, because $L(R,Y)$ does not change. 

In the long run, there is a direct relationship between the inflation rate and changes in the money supply.
$$
\begin{aligned}
M^s &= P \times L(R,Y) \\
P &=M^s/L(R,Y) \\
\Delta P/P &=\Delta M^s/M^s – \Delta L/L
\end{aligned}
$$

- The inflation rate is predicted to equal the growth rate in money supply minus the growth rate in money demand.
- $L$ are only influenced by “real” factors in the long run, and hence, is assumed to be unchanged ($\Delta L=0$​)

- Even year by year, there is a strong positive relation between average Latin American money supply growth and inflation. (Both axes have *logarithmic scales*.)

### Permanent Money Supply Changes

Let’s consider the effect of a *permanent* increase in domestic money supply both in the short run and in the long run.

- A permanent increase in a country’s money supply causes a proportional long-run depreciation of its currency.
    - However, the dynamics of the model predict a large depreciation first and a smaller *subsequent appreciation*.
- A permanent decrease in a country’s money supply causes a proportional long-run appreciation of its currency.
    - However, the dynamics of the model predict a large appreciation first and a smaller *subsequent depreciation*.

- As indicated in panel (d) by the initial jump from $E_{\$ / \euro}^1$ to $E_{\$ / \euro}^2$, the exchange rate overshoots in the short run before settling down to its long-run level, $E_{\$ / \euro}^3$.

### Exchange Rate Overshooting

The exchange rate is said to **overshoot** when its immediate response to a change is greater than its long-run response.

Overshooting is predicted to occur when 

1. monetary policy has an immediate effect on interest rates and on expectations about future exchange rates, 
2. but not on prices and inflation.

Overshooting helps explain why exchange rates are so *volatile*.

- The much greater month-to-month variability of the exchange rate suggests that price levels are relatively sticky in the short run.
