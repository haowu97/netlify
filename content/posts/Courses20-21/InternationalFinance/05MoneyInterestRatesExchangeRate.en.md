## Money Defined: A Brief Review

**Money** is an asset that is widely used as a means of payment.

Different groups of assets may be classified as money.

- Money can be defined narrowly or broadly.
- Currency in circulation, checking deposits, and debit card accounts form a narrow definition of money (**M1**).
- Deposits of currency (e.g. term deposits) are excluded from this narrow definition, although they may act as a substitute for money in a broader definition (**M2**).

Three **functions of money** (why we demand/hold money):

1. as a *medium of exchange*, i.e. a universally accepted means of payments; this is arguably the most important function of money (implies that money is a *highly liquid asset*)
2. as a *unit of account*, i.e. a widely recognized measure of value
3. as a *store of value*, i.e. as a means of transferring purchasing power from the present into the future (an asset)

liquid v.s. Illiquid asset

- Money is a *liquid asset*: it can be easily used to pay for goods and services or to repay debt without substantial transaction costs. 
    - But monetary or liquid assets earn *little or no interest*.
- *Illiquid* assets require substantial transaction costs in terms of time, effort, or fees to convert them to funds for payment. 
    - But they generally earn a higher interest rate or rate of return than monetary assets.

The interest rate is thus *the opportunity cost of holding money*.

## Money Supply & Demand

### Money Supply

The central bank controls the quantity of money that circulates in an economy, the **money supply**.

- In *Australia*, it is controlled by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).
    - The RBA directly regulates the amount of currency in circulation.
    - It indirectly influences the amount of checking deposits, debit card accounts, and other monetary assets. 

The actual *money supply mechanism is quite complex*.

*For the sake of simplicity*, we will assume in this chapter that *central banks are able to increase and decrease the money supply* to have the desired amount of money circulating in an economy.

It will be a vertical straight line when we get to the graphical explanation!

### Money Demand

**Money demand** represents the amount of monetary assets that people are willing to hold (instead of illiquid assets).

In the last chapter, we have seen that an **individual's asset demand** depends on three factors:
- *Expected return* of an asset (if the interest rate of an asset goes up, you don't want to keep your wealth in monetary form and instead, you want to buy high-interest assets)
- The *riskiness* of the asset's expected return (not an important factor for money demand as long as you live in a country that does not experience unexpected price changes)
- The *liquidity* of an asset (higher value of transactions increases the need for liquidity which also increases the demand for money)

The total demand for money by *all households and firms* in the economy is called **aggregate money demand**.

**Three main factors** determine *aggregate (nominal) money demand*:

1. **Interest rates/expected rates of return**: monetary assets pay little or no interest, so the interest rate on non-monetary assets like bonds, loans, and deposits is the opportunity cost of holding monetary assets.
    1. A higher interest rate means a higher opportunity cost of holding monetary assets → lower demand of money.
2. **Prices**: the prices of goods and services bought in transactions will influence the willingness to hold money to conduct those transactions. 
    1. A higher level of average prices means a greater need for liquidity to buy the same amount of goods and services → higher demand of money.
3. **Income**: greater income implies more goods and services can be bought, so that more money is needed to conduct transactions.
    1. A higher **real national income** (GNP) means more goods and services are being produced and bought in transactions, increasing the need for liquidity → higher demand of money.

The aggregate demand of money can be expressed as:
$$
M^d = P \times L(R,Y)
$$
where:

- P is the price level
- Y is *real national income*
- R is a measure of *interest rates on non-monetary assets*
- L(R,Y) is the aggregate demand of real monetary assets

Alternatively:
$$
M^d/P = L(R,Y)
$$
The ratio on the left hand side is "the amount of **real purchasing power** people would like to hold in liquid form".

*Figure*: Aggregate Real Money Demand and the Interest Rate

- The downward-sloping real money demand schedule shows that for a given real income level $Y$, real money demand rises as the interest rate falls.

*Figure*: Effect on the Aggregate Real Money Demand Schedule of a Rise in Real Income

- An increase in real income from $Y^1$ to $Y^2$ raises the demand for real money balances at every level of the interest rate and causes the whole demand schedule to shift upward.

## The money market equilibrium

When no shortages (excess demand) or surpluses (excess supply) of monetary assets exist, we have an **equilibrium** in the money market:
$$
M^s = M^d
$$
**Alternatively**, the equilibrium in the money market occurs when the quantity of real monetary assets supplied matches the quantity of real monetary assets demanded, 
$$
M^s/P = L(R,Y)
$$
The *equilibrium interest rate* is the rate under which $M^s = M^d$.

*Figure*: Determination of the Equilibrium Interest Rate

- With $P$ and $Y$ given and a real money supply of $M^S / P$, money market equilibrium is at point 1. At this point, aggregate real money demand and the real money supply are equal and the equilibrium interest rate is $R^1$.

Suppose that the economy is at *point 2 initially*. 

1. This means that the demand for money falls short of the supply. That is, people hold more money than their desired level.
2. This will make individuals to invest money on interest-bearing assets. That is, people holding excess amount of money will lend it to someone else.
3. Since the initial interest rate is already high, not everyone will successfully lend their money. This will increase the competition among the lenders so that they will lower the interest rate they charge for loans.
4. This eventually *lower the interest rate* until it reaches its equilibrium level.

*Figure*: Effect of an Increase in the Money Supply on the Interest Rate

- For a given price level, $P$, and real income level, $Y$, an increase in the money supply from $M^1$ to $M^2$ Reduces the interest rate from $R^1$ (point 1) to $R^2$ (point 2).

*Figure*: Effect on the Interest Rate of a Rise in Real Income

- Given the real money supply, $ M^{S} / P\left(=Q^{1}\right) $, a rise in real income from $ Y^{1} $ to $ Y^{2} $ raises the interest rate from $ R^{1} $ (point 1) to $ R^{2} $ (point 2).

## Money and the Exchange Rate in the Short Run

First, we start with **short run analysis** where the *price level is assumed to be constant*.

*Figure*: Simultaneous Equilibrium in the U.S. Money Market and the Foreign Exchange Market 

- Both asset markets are in equilibrium at the interest rate $ R_{\$}^{1} $​​ and exchange rate $ E_{\$ / \epsilon}^{1} ; $​​ at these values, *money supply equals money demand* (point 1) and the *interest parity condition* holds (point $ 1^{\prime}$​​).

### Changes in Domestic Money Supply

Intuition:

1. An *increase* in a country’s money supply causes interest rates to fall, rates of return on domestic currency deposits to fall, and the domestic currency to depreciate.
2. A *decrease* in a country’s money supply causes interest rates to rise, rates of return on domestic currency deposits to rise, and the domestic currency to appreciate.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210802223028.png)

Initial money supply in the US economy is $M^1_{US}$. At this money supply level, money market is in equilibrium at point 1 and foreign exchange market is in equilibrium at point 1'.

Now *suppose that the FED increases the dollar supply* to $M^2_{US}$ (downward shift in the horizontal line in the lower half of the figure). Then, the following sequence of events will occur:

1. Excess supply of US dollars lowers the interest rate on dollar assets.
2. Lower interest rate on dollar holdings will make euro assets more attractive. Therefore, dollar holders will try to exchange their dollar holdings with euro.
3. As more people willing to get euro assets, euro holders will ask more dollars for each euro they lend (appreciation of a euro/depreciation of a dollar).

### Changes in Foreign Money Supply

How would a change in the supply of euros affect the U.S. money market and foreign exchange markets?

1. An *increase* in the supply of euros causes a depreciation of the euro (an appreciation of the dollar).
    1. The increase in the supply of euros reduces interest rates in the EU, reducing the expected rate of return on euro deposits.
    2. This reduction in the expected rate of return on euro deposits causes the euro to depreciate.
    3. We predict no change in the U.S. money market due to the change in the supply of euros.
2. A *decrease* in the supply of euros causes an appreciation of the euro (a depreciation of the dollar).

## Money, the Price Level, and the Exchange Rate in the Long Run

In the *short run*, prices do not have sufficient time to adjust to market conditions --- we say that prices are “**rigid**” in the short run. 

- The analysis heretofore has been a short-run analysis. 

In the *long run*, prices of factors of production and of output have sufficient time to adjust to market conditions.

- Wages adjust to the demand and supply of labor.
- Real output and income are determined by the amount of workers and other factors of production—by the economy’s productive capacity—*not by the quantity of money supplied*. 
- Long-run equilibrium is a state that would occur if *prices are perfectly flexible* and always adjusted immediately to *preserve full employment*

*In the long run*, the quantity of *money supplied is predicted not to influence the amount of output, (real) interest rates, and the aggregate demand of real monetary assets* $L(R,Y)$.

However, the quantity of money supplied is predicted to make the level of average prices *adjust proportionally* in the long run.

- The equilibrium condition $M^s/P = L(R,Y)$ shows that $P$ is predicted to adjust proportionally when $M^s$ adjusts, because $L(R,Y)$ does not change. 

【Example】In 2005, Turkey redefined its currency unit by removing 6 zeros from its previous currency. That is, the new Turkish Lira becomes 1/1,000,000 of the old one.

- But this didn't affect either the interest rate and the real output. It simply lowered all lira prices to 1/1,000,000 of their old values.

In the long run, there is a direct relationship between the inflation rate and changes in the money supply.
$$
\begin{aligned}
M^s &= P \times L(R,Y) \\
P &=M^s/L(R,Y) \\
\Delta P/P &=\Delta M^s/M^s – \Delta L/L
\end{aligned}
$$

- The inflation rate is predicted to equal the growth rate in money supply minus the growth rate in money demand.
- $L$ are only influenced by “real” factors in the long run, and hence, is assumed to be unchanged ($\Delta L=0$​)

*Figure*: Average Money Growth and Inflation in Western Hemisphere Developing Countries, by Year, 1987–2007

- Even year by year, there is a strong positive relation between average Latin American money supply growth and inflation. (Both axes have *logarithmic scales*.)

### Permanent Money Supply Changes

Let’s consider the effect of a *permanent* increase in domestic money supply both in the short run and in the long run.

- A *permanent increase in a country’s money supply* causes a *proportional long-run depreciation* of its currency.
    - However, the dynamics of the model predict a large depreciation first and a smaller *subsequent appreciation*.
- A *permanent decrease in a country’s money supply* causes a *proportional long-run appreciation* of its currency.
    - However, the dynamics of the model predict a large appreciation first and a smaller *subsequent depreciation*.

【Example】Suppose than one big mac costs ＄2 in the US and e1.6 in France. This means that the USD/Euro exchange rate is ＄1.25/€.
1. Suppose the money supply is doubled in the US. This causes all prices to double as well.
2. Now, the price of big mac is ＄4 in the US but there is no change in French McDonald's franchises.
3. This implies that the exchange rate between USD and Euro becomes ＄2.5/€. In other words, USD depreciates against Euro and the value of USD in Euro terms is halved.

*Figure*: Time Paths of U.S. Economic Variables After a Permanent Increase in the U.S. Money Supply

- As indicated in panel (d) by the initial jump from $E_{\$ / \euro}^1$ to $E_{\$ / \euro}^2$, the exchange rate overshoots in the short run before settling down to its long-run level, $E_{\$ / \euro}^3$.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210803145630.png)

There is one thing worth mentioning in the previous analysis.

- Exchange rate depreciation is much higher right after the US money supply increase, but later USD appreciates against Euro but this appreciation is not enough to recover the initial depreciation.

### Exchange Rate Overshooting

The exchange rate is said to **overshoot** when its immediate response to a change is greater than its long-run response.

Overshooting is predicted to occur when 

1. monetary policy has an immediate effect on interest rates and on expectations about future exchange rates, 
2. but not on prices and inflation.

Overshooting occurs in the model because **prices do not adjust quickly (short run price rigidity)**, but expectations and asset markets do.

Overshooting helps explain why exchange rates are so *volatile*.

*Figure*: Month-to-Month Variability of the Dollar/Yen Exchange Rate and of the U.S./Japan Price Level Ratio, 1980–2009

- The much greater month-to-month variability of the exchange rate suggests that price levels are relatively sticky in the short run.
