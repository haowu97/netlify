The two concepts in international macroeconomics are particularly important: 

1. national income accounting and 
2. balance of payment accounting.

## National Income Accounting

*GDP* measures the value of goods and services produced within a country's borders, by citizens and non-citizens alike.

- *GDP* is the most commonly used by global economies.

$$
Y^{GDP} = C+I+G+\underbrace{(X-M)}_{\text{Net foreign contrburtion to the GDP}}
$$

*GNP* measures the value of goods and services produced by only a country's citizens but both domestically and abroad.

- GNP will count the economic activities of expatriates and other
    citizens outside the country's borders but GDP will not.
- GDP will consider the activities of non-citizens within those borders, but GNP will not.

$$
Y^{GNP} = C+I+G+\underbrace{(X-M+BIREC)}_{\text{Net foreign contrburtion to the GNP}}
$$
BIREC: Balance of Income Receipts from Employment and Capital.

### National Income Identity for an Open Economy

The national income identity for an open economy is
$$
Y = C + I + G + EX - IM = C + I + G + CA
$$
Expenditure by domestic individuals and institutions: $C+I+G$.

Net expenditure by foreign individuals and institutions: $EX-IM$
$$
CA= EX -IM = Y - (C+ I + G )
$$
When *production (Y) > domestic expenditure (C+I+G)*, EX > IM: CA > 0 and trade balance > 0

- when a country exports more than it imports, it earns more income from exports than it spends on imports
- **net foreign wealth is increasing**
- then country has **current account surplus**.

When *production (Y) < domestic expenditure (C+I+G)*, EX < IM: CA < 0 and trade balance < 0

- when a country exports less than it imports, it earns less income from exports than it spends on imports
- **net foreign wealth is decreasing**
- then country has **current account deficit**

$CA$​​ can also be expressed as $NX$​​(Net export).

### Saving and the Current Account

*National saving* (S) = national income (Y) that is not spent on consumption (C) or government purchases (G).
$$
S = Y - C - G
$$
An open economy can save 

1. by building up its capital stock (higher I) 
2. or by acquiring foreign wealth (higher CA).

$$
S = I + CA
$$
For *closed economy with government*, $CA = 0$, than:
$$
S = I
$$
For *open economy with government*
$$
S - I = CA
$$

1. $\mathrm{CA}>0$ implies $\mathrm{S}-\mathrm{I}>0$ and $\mathrm{S}>\mathrm{I}$
2. $\mathrm{CA}<0$ implies $\mathrm{S}-\mathrm{I}<0$ and $\mathrm{S}<\mathrm{I}$

### Private and Government Saving

*Private saving*, is the part of the disposable income that is saved rather than consumed:
$$
S^p= Y^d - C = Y -T -C
$$
where $Y^d = Y - T$ is *disposable income*.

*Government saving* (taxes minus spending):
$$
S^g = T - G
$$
Link between $S^p$, $S^g$ and national saving:
$$
S = (Y -T -C)+ (T -G) = S^p+ S^g
$$

We can re-write the national income identity using $ S^{p} $ and $ S^{g} $ :

$$
S^{g}+S^{p}=S=I+C A
$$

This implies

$$
S^{p}=I+C A-S^{g}=I+C A+G-T
$$

The above equation can be interpreted as follows: P*rivate savings increases when government runs a budget deficit* ($\mathrm{G}-\mathrm{T}>0$​​ implies a government budget deficit).

## Balance of Payments Accounts

A country’s *balance of payments* accounts accounts for its payments to and its receipts from foreigners.

### Double-entry Bookkeeping

Every transaction is booked twice - debit and credit, because otherwise the BoP would imply that someone is giving up something for nothing.

Every international transaction involves two parties, and **each transaction enters the accounts twice**: once as a credit (e.g. goods) and once as a debit (e.g. money).

That's why the *balance of payment should always be equal to 0*!

The general principle: **whatever enters the country is a debit(+), and anything that exits is a credit(-)** (whether it be goods or money).

- *Investment abroad* may lead to some confusion, as this represents a debit. This can be reconciled by the above general rule by considering investment in foreign countries as the purchase of an asset from abroad.

*Paying for imports* (e.g. import of cars in Canada from the US)

- Debit: balance of goods, in Canada
- Credit: short-term capital account, in Canada (regardless if payment is in cash, bank cheque, or loan)
- Every movement of goods is offset by a balancing movement of capital.

*Paying for asset purchases* (e.g. German company buys a hotel in Quebec)

- Debit: banking flows in Canada
- Credit: direct investment

### Accounts and subaccounts

Accounts and subaccounts: *Cumulative Balances*

---

CURRENT ACCOUNT (CA)

- Merchandise: *Merchandise balance*
- Services
    - Transportation
    - Tourism
    - Business and professional services: *Balances of goods and services*
- Income receipts
    - Interest and dividend payments,
    - Earnings of workers operating in foreign countries: *Balances of goods, services and income*
- Unilateral transfers
    - Government grants
    - Private remittances: *Current account balance*

CAPITAL ACCOUNT: Records special asset transfers, but this is a minor account for most cuntries.

FINANCIAL ACCOUNT / PRIVATE CAPITAL ACCOUNT (KA)

- Direct investment
- Portfolio investment (securities and banking flows)
    - Long term: *Basic balance*
    - Short term: *Overall balance*

OFFICIAL RESERVE TRANSACTIONS (ORT)

- Changes in foreign central banks’ holding of domestic assets
- Changes in the domestic central bank’s holding of foreign assets
    - Gold
    - IMF credits and SDR
    - Foreign exchange reserves

Following examples treat the U.S. as home country.

【Good import】Import Fax machine and pay for purchase with a $1,000 check.

|                                                              | Credit | Debit  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ------ |
| Fax machine purchase (Current account, good import)          |        | $1,000 |
| Sale of bank deposit by Citibank (Financial account, asset sale) | $1,000 |        |

【Service import】Suppose that during your travels in France, you pay $200 for a fine dinner at the Restaurant. Lacking cash, you place the charge on your Visa credit card.

|                                                              | Credit | Debit |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ----- |
| Meal purchase (Current account, U.S. service import)         |        | $200  |
| Sale of claim on First Card (Financial account, U.S. asset sale) | $200   |       |

【Asset purchase】buys a newly issued share of stock of BP in the U.K.

|                                                              | Credit | Debit |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ----- |
| purchase of a share of BP (Financial account, U.S. asset purchase) |        | $95   |
| Sale of claim on First Card (Financial account, U.S. asset sale) | $95    |       |

Note that acquisition of foreign assets enters as debit because the US must pay foreigners for those assets. Likewise, disposal of US assets will enter as credit because foreigners owning US assets must pay to get them.

【Transfer payment】Consider how the U.S. balance of payments accounts are affected when U.S. banks forgive (that is, announce that they will simply forget about) $5,000 in debt owed to them by the government of the imaginary country of Bygonia.

|                                                              | Credit | Debit |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ----- |
| U.S. banks’ debt forgiveness (Capital account, U.S. transfer payment) |        | $95   |
| Reduction in banks’ claims on Bygonia (Financial account, U.S. asset sale) | $95    |       |

### Current account

*Exports* (X): Goods and services that are produced at home and sold to a “foreign country”

*Imports* (M): Goods and services that are produced in a foreign country and sold at home

*Net exports* (NX) (*trade balance*): the value of a nation’s exports minus the value of its imports

- *Trade surplus* (NX > 0): an excess of exports over imports. (trade balance is greater zero or positive)
- *Trade deficit* (NX < 0): an excess of imports over exports (trade balance is smaller zero or negative)
- *Balanced trade*: a situation in which exports equal imports. (trade balance equals zero)

| Subaccounts                          | Items                                        | Example                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Merchandise / Goods                  | Goods (visibles, tangibles)                  | A  Canadian citizen buys a Porsche or Alberta sells oil to the U.S. |
| Services                             | Services  (invisibles intangibles)           | A Swiss going on  vacation to the sea is always an import of services |
| Primary income (factor income) BIREC | Compensation of  employees Investment income | A Canadian works  in Seattle or a German professor in Ottawa. A private equity company earns  profits on its investments abroad |
| Secondary income (transfers)         | Donations  (Unilateral transactions)         | Foreign aid,  money transfers to the family abroad           |

*Factors of influence*

1. The tastes of consumers for domestic and foreign goods.
2. The **prices** of goods at home and abroad.
3. The **exchange rates** at which people can use domestic currency to buy foreign currencies.
4. The **incomes** of consumers at home and abroad.
5. The **cost of transporting** goods from country to country.
6. The **policies** of the government towards international trade.

Export:
$$
X = X^{DD}(\underbrace{P_{-}, P^{*}_{+}, e_{+}}_{e^{real}}, Y^{*}_{+}, \text{Transport Cost}_{-}, \text{Politics}, \text{Preference})
$$
Import:
$$
M = M^{DD}(\underbrace{P_{+}, P^{*}_{-}, e_{-}}_{e^{real}}, Y_{+},  \text{Transport Cost}_{-}, \text{Politics}, \text{Preference})
$$
where e is exchange rate(price quotation), + means positive relation, - means negative relation.

### Financial Account/ Private Capital Account

*Capital exports*: Purchases of foreign assets by domestic residents

- Example: A Canadian buys Stocks of the Coca Cola Company

*Capital imports*: Purchases of domestic assets by foreigners

- Example: A Japanese bank buys Canadian government bonds

*Net capital outflow*: The purchase of foreign assets by domestic residents minus the purchase of domestic assets by foreigners

*Factors of influence:*

- The real interest rates being paid on foreign assets
- The real interest rates being paid on domestic assets
- The perceived economic and political risks of holding assets abroad. 
    - Most important: Exchange risk
- The government policies that affect foreign ownership of domestic assets.

Capital exports:
$$
Cap_X = f(i_{-}, i_{+}^{*}, e^{\text{expected}}_{+}, politics)
$$
Capital imports:
$$
Cap_M = f(i_{+}, i_{-}^{*}, e^{\text{expected}}_{-}, politics)
$$
where e is exchange rate(price quotation).

### In Reality: Errors and Omissions

Errors and omissions lead to a statistical discrepancy:

- Statistics does not observe directly debit and credit side of the transaction since data from a transaction may come from *different sources that differ in coverage, accuracy, and timing*.
- <u>The balance of payments accounts therefore seldom balance</u> in practice. Therefore, if debit does not equal credit, the difference between the sum of debit and the sum of credit is called "*statistical discrepancy*" or "*errors and omissions*"
- <u>The statistical discrepancy is the account added to or subtracted from the financial account</u> to make it balance with the current account and capital account.

### U.S. Balance of Payments Accounts

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210813222016.png)

The sum of Current Account and Capital Account equals to -＄463.01 billion.

This means that the US needs ＄463.01 billion to cover its current account deficit (by either borrowing from foreigners or by selling assets to them).

The net financial account value is ＄195.23 billion. This implies that the United States incurred ＄267.78 billion less in foreign debt than it actually needed to fund its current plus capital account deficit!

### BoP Accounting Identities

Because every debit has an offsetting credit somewhere,
$$
CA + KA + ORT ≡ 0
$$
In the case of floating exchange rates **ORT = 0** because the central bank does not intervene in the exchange market. Than 
$$
CA = -KA
$$
Since
$$
CA = X – M = NX(\text{Net Exports})
$$
and
$$
-KA = Cap_{X} – Cap_{M} = NCO(\text{Net Capital Outflow})
$$
We find that
$$
NX = NCO
$$
with $S - I = NX$, we have
$$
NCO = S - I
$$
Then,
$$
I + NCO = S = S^p+S^g
$$
