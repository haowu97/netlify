## Nominal exchange rate

*Exchange rates*: The price of one nation’s currency in terms of another currency. Namely, the rate at which a person can trade the currency of one country for the currency of another.

- *Base currency* per *Quote currency*, the number of Base currency needed to buy 1 Quote currency.

**Textbook notation**: 

`AUD1.5/USD` or `AUD1.5 = USD 1`

- the number of AUD needed to buy 1 USD, or number of AUD you can buy with 1USD
- you need 1.5 AUD to buy 1 USD, or you can buy 1.5AUD with 1 USD

`¥93.17/A$` or `A$0.0107/¥`: 

- How much can be exchanged for one dollar? ¥93.17/A$
- How much can be exchanged for one yen? A$0.0107/ ¥

However, **industry notation**:

- USD/AUD → number of AUD needed to buy 1USD
- … yes, it can get confusing

### Exchange Rate Quotes

- *Direct quote/ (Price quote)*: units of domestic currency per unit of foreign currency; quoting domestic currency first (in the numerator)
- *Indirect quote/ (quantity quote)*: units of foreign currency per unit of domestic currency; quoting foreign currency first (in the numerator)

$$
Indirect = \frac{1}{Direct}
$$

### Exchange Rate Changes

*Appreciation/ depreciation*: value of a currency increases/decreases in terms of another currency, driven by **market forces**, e.g. in free float systems.

*Revaluation/ devaluation*: value of a currency is changed by the **government**, e.g. in fixed rate systems

A depreciated currency is less valuable, and therefore it can buy fewer foreign-produced goods that are denominated in foreign currency.

- A Honda costs `¥2,500,000 x $0.0107/¥ = $26,750`
- Less expensive than `$30,000 at $0.0120/¥`

A depreciated currency means that imports are more expensive and domestically-produced goods and exports are less expensive. 

- **A depreciated currency lowers the price of exports relative to the price of imports** (OR: raises the price of imports relative to the price exports). 
- The reverse holds under an appreciated currency.

#### Calculating exchange rate changes

Amount of currency appreciation/depreciation = (New value - Old value) / Old value 

【Example 1】Suppose the Canadian dollar devaluate against the euro: The exchange rate goes down from $ e_{1}=0.8 \frac{E U R}{C A D} $​ to $ e_{2}=0.72 \frac{E U R}{C A D} $​.

This is a devaluation by
$$
(e_2-e_1)/e_1 = \text{-10\%}
$$
【Example 2】If the Thai baht fell 17% against the US dollar, by how much has the USD appreciated against the baht?

Let $ e_{1}=\mathrm{USD} / \mathrm{THB} $, then $ \mathrm{THB} / \mathrm{USD}=1 / e_{1} $

Change in USD/THB is
$$
\left(e_{1}-e_{0}\right) / e_{0}=-17 \% \rightarrow e_{1}=-0.17 e_{0}+e_{0}=0.83 e_{0} 
$$
Change in THB/USD is
$$
\left(1 / e_{1}-1 / e_{0}\right) /\left(1 / e_{0}\right)=\left(e_{0}-e_{1}\right) / e_{1} 
\rightarrow \left(e_{0}-0.83 e_{0}\right) / 0.83 e_{0}=0.17 e_{0} / 0.83 e_{0}=0.2048
$$
The USD appreciated $ 20.48 \% $ relative to the Thai baht

Note: Change in USD/THB $\neq$ change in THB/USD!

## Real exchange rate

The *real exchange rate* is the rate of exchange for goods and services across countries. 

- In other words, it is the **relative value/price/cost of goods and services across countries**: the rate at which a person can trade the goods and services of one country for the goods and services of another
- For example, it is the dollar price of a European group of goods and services relative to the dollar price of an American group of goods and services:

$$
q_{U S / E U}=\left(E_{\$ / €} \times P_{E U}\right) / P_{U S}
$$

**The real exchange rate is a key determinant of how much a country**
**exports and imports**.

1. A *real depreciation* of the value of U.S. products means a fall in a dollar’s purchasing power of EU products relative to a dollar’s purchasing power of U.S. products.
    1. This implies that U.S. goods become less expensive and less valuable relative to EU goods.
    2. This implies that the value of U.S. goods relative to value of EU goods falls
    3. As a result, U.S. exports rise, and U.S. imports fall, and both of these changes **raise U.S. net exports**.
2. A *real appreciation* of the value of U.S. products means a rise in a dollar’s purchasing power of EU products relative to a dollar’s purchasing power of U.S. products.
    1. This implies that U.S. goods become more expensive and more valuable relative to EU goods.
    2. This implies that the value of U.S. goods relative to value of EU goods rises. 
    3. As a result, U.S. exports fall, and U.S. imports rise, and both of these changes **reduce U.S. net exports**.

## Central Bank Reputations and Expectations

A nation’s official monetary authority, the *central bank* uses monetary policy to achieve price stability, set interest rates, or maintain a certain currency value.

Fiat money is no longer linked to an underlying asset, so 

- central banks play a crucial role in setting the risk associated with holding a currency.
- Risk depends on central bank’s ability to maintain price stability, target values, etc.
- Investors’ expectations of central bank behavior affect exchange rates

*Central bank independence*: avoid direct control by government officials that could use monetary policy for short-term political gains at the costs of long-term economic issues

- Non-independent central bank may be forced to monetize budget deficit by printing money to finance public sector spending
- E.g. Post WWI Germany, Zimbabwe

Independent central banks tend to have

- Lower inflation rates
- Higher economic growth

Example: New Zealand’s central bank was made independent in 1990: inflation dropped to 1.3% and cut government spending on welfare programs.

*Central Bank Interventions*: Official purchases or sales of currencies to influence local (domestic) currency.

*Unsterilized intervention*

- e.g. European Central Bank (ECB) wants to let USD/EUR depreciate → increase supply of EUR or increase demand for USD
- Buy USD in exchange for EUR (i.e. sell EUR for USD)
- However, EU money supply and therefore **inflation increases**

*Sterilized intervention*: **neutralize inflation**

- Open-market operations to keep money supply constant
- usually by buying or selling treasury securities
- e.g. ECB can reduce EUR supply by selling euro-denominated securities to public
- However, assumes public views euro-denominated securities as perfect substitutes for dollar-denominated securities, portfolio rebalancing can result in a null effect on exchange rates.
