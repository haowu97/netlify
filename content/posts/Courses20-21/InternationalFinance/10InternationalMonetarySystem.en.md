## The Trilemma or the “Impossible Trinity”

Ideally, policy makers want

1. A stable exchange rate: Less risk for doing business overseas, decreases economic volatility
2. An independent monetary policy: Control over money supply and interest rates to stabilize economy
3. Capital market integration (free flow of capital):Portfolio diversification, better capital allocation, lower cost of capital

At any point in time, a country can pursue two of the three, but **never all three simultaneously**

- Option 1: Monetary independence and free flow of capital, but volatile exchange rate, e.g. USA, Flexible Exchange Rates
- Option 2: Fixed exchange rate and free flow of capital, but no monetary independence, e.g. Hong Kong, Gold Standard
- Option 3: Monetary independence and fixed exchange rate, but capital controls, e.g. China, Bretton Woods

Attempts to achieve all three by Mexico, Thailand, Korea, Russia, Brazil, … have failed. When countries attempt to achieve all 3 of the impossible trilemma dimensions and speculators recognized these were not sustainable:

- 1994-1995: Mexican Crisis
  - IMF bailout created moral hazard
- 1997: Asian currency crisis
- 1998: Russian crisis
- 1998-1999: Brazilian crisis

## Exchange Rate Systems

Currently, the international monetary system is a hybrid system

- Floating Currencies: Free (clean) float
- Managed Floating Currencies/ Dirty float
- Fixed/Pegged Currencies
  - Extreme case: dollarization/euroization
- Target-Zone Arrangement
- Crawling Peg

### Floating Currencies——Free (clean) float

Determined by supply and demand market forces: Driven by inflation, interest rates, and economic growth

Helps stabilize economy

- Negative shock → lower exchange rate → higher exports
- Allows independent monetary policy 

But more economic volatility and more risky business decisions

E.g. US, Japan, Australia, EU

### Managed Float/ Dirty float

**Determined by market forces with some central bank intervention**

Most countries intervene in the foreign exchange market at some point

- To smooth out temporary fluctuations by buying or selling currency on the open market
- T o reduce economic volatility and uncertainty
- But less transparency, short-lived changes, and requires sufficient reserves

E.g. Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, South Africa.

### Fixed/Pegged Rate

Target exchange rate set by government, with central bank intervention(buy/sell currency) if rate deviates.

Reduces economic volatility, benefits trade and investment

But no monetary independence - requires coordinated monetary policies

- All members of the system must have same inflation rate
- Often chosen by emerging economies

E.g. Gold Standard, Bretton Woods.

Extreme cases of fixed rate commitment: 

- Fix a currency to another or a basket of currencies, often implemented using a currency board.
- Dollarization (euroization): replacement of local currency with USD(EUR)
- e.g. Hong Kong (HKD exchange rate remains stable within a band of HK$7.75-7.85 to one USD), Ecuador, El Salvador and Panama (tied to and equal to the USD)
- No monetary autonomy

### Target-Zone Arrangement

Determined by market forces **within a margin** around agreed-upon fixed exchange rates

- Allows for some exchange rate fluctuation
- Intervention to maintain rates within margins

But setting correct target-zone is not straightforward

Changing the target-zone or margin destroys credibility
E.g. pre-Euro EMS

### Crawling Peg

Under a crawling peg, the local currency depreciates against a reference currency or currency basket on a regular, controlled basis.

- Used to ease transition from e.g. a fixed to a flexible exchange rate or from a fixed to another peg rate
- E.g. Polish, Brazil, China

Unofficial pegging: resisting fundamental exchange rate movements

## A Brief History of the International Monetary System

Classic Gold Standard (1821 – 1944, with a break for WWI): Currencies were pegged to gold

Bretton Woods (1946 - 1971): Currencies were pegged to USD which was pegged to gold

Floating Exchange Rates (1971 - …)

### The Gold Standard (1821 – 1944)

*Money can be exchanged for gold at a fixed rate*.

Gold is durable, storable, portable, easily recognized, divisible, and easily standardized.

Value of gold is relatively stable over long periods of time due to high production costs.

Require all governments to play by the rules.

Large gold and capital flows led to unrealistic exchange rates.

【Example】

$ 1 \$=1 $ ounce gold

 $ 1 £=2 $ ounces gold

Then, $ 1 £ \cdot e=2 \$ \Rightarrow \mathrm{e}(\$ / £)=2 \$ / £ $.

#### Money Supply-Price Mechanism

Using the example of a restrictive monetary policy

1. Money supply decreases
2. Price level falls
3. Net exports increase: Exports increase, imports decrease
4. Foreign exchange supply increases
5. Gold reserves increase
6. Money supply increases

### Bretton Woods (1946 - 1971)

USD pegged at \$35/ounce gold while all currencies pegged to USD

- e.g. DM was set at 1/140 of an ounce gold = ​\$0.25/DM

Maintained by buying or selling USD in open market.

Created the IMF and World Bank.

The system allowed stable exchange rates but less flexible economic policies.

Consequence: 

- Asymmetric monetary policy
- Required coordinated monetary policy.

1971: Oil price shocks caused a run on gold and USD convertibility terminated 

#### International Finance Institutions

*International Monetary Fund(IMF)*: Oversees exchange rate policies and provides rescue funding to countries in crisis

*World Bank*: Lends to developing countries and support business entering developing markets

*Bank for International Settlements (BIS)*

- Central bank for industrial countries’ central banks
- Helps manage and invest central banks’ foreign exchange reserves
- The BIS is located in Basel, Switzerland.
- 58 banks out of 54 countries are customers.

### Floating Exchange Rates (1971 - …)

Exchange rates are formed according to the *law of supply and demand* on the foreign exchange market.

In theory: exchange rate changes offset international inflation differences

- High inflation → currency depreciation → increases competitiveness without wage/employment adjustments
- Real exchange rate stability

In practice: increased real exchange rate volatility, more *economic uncertainty* due to higher future government policy uncertainty.

Back to fixed rate system?

- Requires credibility and price stability
- Average duration of fixed rate systems is only 4.67 years …

Advantages:

- You can choose your own inflation rate (autonomous interest rate policy)
- No speculation possible (in theory)
- No under/overvaluations (in theory)
- Efficient allocation of capital

Disadvantages:

- Flexible exchange rates cause transaction costs.
- Flexible exchange rates generate avoidable risks.
- Flexible exchange rates reduce transparency in goods markets.
- Flexible exchange rates can trigger and intensify currency crises

#### The European Monetary Union (EMU)

In 1999, the 11 founding member countries of EMU surrendered their monetary autonomy and gave up their right to create money. 

*European Central Bank(ECB)* is the only central bank with power to  issue currency, the Euro.

Nations must meet inflation, currency stability, and deficit spending standards.

Governments can issue Euro-denominated bonds, but are unable to print money to service debts.

ECB provides price stability, while member states are responsible for budgetary and borrowing needs

Benefits

- Lower cross-border currency conversion costs
- Lower exchange rate risk and better price transparency
- Increased trade, more competition

Costs

- No independent monetary policy
- Slower macroeconomic adjustment to e.g. crises
- Issue of splitting profit from money creation 
- The European debt crisis

Is the EMU an optimum currency area? Time will tell!
