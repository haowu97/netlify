A **reverse merger**, also referred to as a “reverse takeover” or a “backdoor listing,” is a process whereby a private company is merged into a public company and the private company’s ownership team takes over control of the combined publicly traded company. At the time of the merger, the public company may be an empty “shell” (i.e., a dormant and non-operating entity) or it may have an existing set of assets and liabilities.

Shell values reflect the marginal benefit/cost to the firms engaged in a RM, they are a “shadow price” for the economic cost of gaining access to China’s public equity market.

This extreme imbalance between supply and demand gives rise to listed firms’ “shell value,” which reflects a firm’s scarce and valuable public listing status in China.

In the first stage, we manually collect detailed information on a comprehensive sample of reverse mergers (RMs) in China that were completed in January 2007 to April 2016.

题目：上市公司売价值与资源配置效率

提出了度量上市公司股价中壳价值含量的指标ESV/MV。我们定义一个上市公司的期望壳价值(ESV)等于借壳交易能够实现的壳价值(SV)与被借壳概率(Pr)的乘积，并用期望壳价值(ESV)与市值(MV)比来度量上市公司的壳价值含量(ESV/MV)。

$$
E S V / M V=\frac{S V \times \operatorname{Pr}}{M V}
$$

其中，SV与Pr分别通过以下回归模型估计

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ln S V_{i t}&=a_{0}+a_{1} \ln M V_{i-1}+a_{2}\left(\ln M V_{i t-1}\right)^{2}+a_{3} S O E_{i t-1}+e_{i} \\
 P r_{i t}\left(\right.\text { Shell }_{i t}=1)&=b_{0}+b_{1} \text { Rsize }_{i-1}+b_{2} O P_{i t-1}+b_{3} \text { Sales }_{-} g_{i t-1} \\ &+b_{4} S T_{i t-1}+b_{5} I P O_{-} r e j_{i t-1}+b_{6} \text { Insider }_{i t-1} \\ &+b_{7} \text { Return }_{i t-1}+e_{i t} \end{aligned}
$$
