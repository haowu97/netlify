## Overview: mass extinction

An **extinction event** (also known as a **mass extinction** or **biotic crisis**) is a widerspread and rapid decrease in the *biodiversity* on Earth. Such an event is identified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of *multicellular organisms*. It occurs when the rate of extinction increases with respect to the rate of *speciation*. Estimates of the number of major mass extinctions in the last 540 million years range from *as few as five to more than twenty*. These difference stem from the *threshold chosen* for describing an extinction event as “major”, and the date chosen to measure past diversity.

Because most diversity and biomass on Earth is **microbial**, and thus difficult to measure, recorded extinction events affect the easily observed, biologically complex component of the *biosphere* rather than the total diversity and abundance of life. Extinction occurs at an *uneven rate*. Based on the *fossil record*, the background rate of extinctions on Earth is about two to five taxonomic families of marine animals every million years. *Marine fossils are mostly used to measure extinction rates* because of their superior fossil record and stratigraphic range compared to land animals.

**The Great Oxygenation Event**, which occurred around 2.45 billion years ago, was *probably the first major extinction event*. Since the Cambrian explosion, *five further major mass extinctions* have significantly exceeded the background extinction rate. The most recent and arguably best-known, *the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event*, which occurred approximately 66 Ma (million years ago), was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time. In addition to the five major mass extinctions, there are numerous minor ones as well, and the *ongoing mass extinction caused by human activity* is sometimes called **the sixth extinction**. Mass extinctions seem to be a mainly Phanerozoic phenomenon, with *extinction rates low before large complex organisms arose*.

## Major extinction events

### Ordovician–Silurian extinction

**Ordovician–Silurian extinction events** (End Ordovician or O–S): *450–440 Ma* at the Ordovician–Silurian transition. Two events occurred that killed off *27% of all families, 57% of all genera and 60% to 70% of all species*. Together they are ranked by many scientists as the *second-largest* of the five major extinctions in Earth's history in terms of percentage of genera that became extinct. In May 2020, studies suggested the cause of the mass extinction was *due to global warming*, *related to volcanism*, and *anoxia*, and not due, as considered earlier, to cooling and glaciation.

### Late Devonian extinction

**Late Devonian extinction**: *375–360 Ma* near the Devonian–Carboniferous transition. At the end of the Frasnian Age in the later part(s) of the Devonian Period, a prolonged series of extinctions eliminated about 19% of all families, 50% of all genera and at least 70% of all species. This extinction event *lasted perhaps as long as 20 million years*, and there is evidence for a series of extinction pulses within this period.

### Permian–Triassic extinction

**Permian–Triassic extinction event** (End Permian): *252 Ma* at the Permian–Triassic transition. *Earth's largest extinction* killed 57% of all families, 83% of all genera and 90% to 96% of all species (53% of marine families, 84% of marine genera, about 96% of all marine species and an estimated 70% of land species, including insects). The highly successful marine arthropod, the trilobite, became extinct. The evidence regarding plants is less clear, but new taxa became dominant after the extinction. The "Great Dying" had enormous *evolutionary significance*: on land, it ended the primacy of *mammal-like reptiles*. The recovery of *vertebrates* took 30 million years, but the vacant niches created the opportunity for *archosaurs to become ascendant*. In the seas, the percentage of animals that were sessile dropped from 67% to 50%. The whole late Permian was a *difficult time for at least marine life*, even before the "Great Dying".

### Triassic–Jurassic extinction

**Triassic–Jurassic extinction event** (End Triassic): *201.3 Ma* at the Triassic–Jurassic transition. About 23% of all families, 48% of all genera (20% of marine families and 55% of marine genera) and 70% to 75% of all species became extinct. Most *non-dinosaurian archosaurs*, most *therapsids*, and most of the *large amphibians* were eliminated, *leaving dinosaurs with little terrestrial competition*. Non-dinosaurian archosaurs continued to dominate aquatic environments, while non-archosaurian diapsids continued to dominate marine environments. The Temnospondyl lineage of *large amphibians* also survived until the Cretaceous in Australia (e.g., Koolasuchus).

### Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction

**Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event** (End Cretaceous, K–Pg extinction, or formerly *K–T extinction*): *66 Ma* at the Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) – Paleogene (Danian) transition interval. The event formerly called the Cretaceous-Tertiary or K–T extinction or K–T boundary is now officially named the Cretaceous–Paleogene (or K–Pg) extinction event. About 17% of all families, 50% of all genera and 75% of all species became extinct. In the seas all the ammonites, plesiosaurs and mosasaurs disappeared and the percentage of *sessile animals (those unable to move about)* was reduced to about 33%. All *non-avian dinosaurs became extinct* during that time. *Mammals and birds, the latter descended from theropod dinosaurs, emerged as dominant large land animals.*

## Causes

There is still *debate about the causes of all mass extinctions*. In general, large extinctions may result when a biosphere under long-term stress undergoes a *short-term shock*. An underlying mechanism appears to be present in the correlation of extinction and origination rates to diversity. *High diversity leads to a persistent increase in extinction rate*; low diversity to a persistent increase in origination rate. These presumably ecologically controlled relationships likely *amplify* smaller perturbations (asteroid impacts, etc.) to produce the global effects observed.

Most widely supported explanations:

### Flood basalt events

A flood basalt is the result of a *giant volcanic eruption* or *series of eruptions* that covers large stretches of land or the ocean floor with basalt lava. The formation of large igneous provinces by flood basalt events could have:

- produced *dust and particulate aerosols* which *inhibited photosynthesis and* thus caused food chains to collapse both on land and at sea.
- emitted *sulfur oxides* which were *precipitated as acid rain* and *poisoned* many organisms, contributing further to the collapse of food chains
- emitted *carbon dioxide* and thus possibly causing sustained *global warming* once the dust and particulate aerosols dissipated.

Flood basalt events occur as pulses of activity punctuated by dormant periods. As a result, they are likely to cause the climate to oscillate between cooling and warming, but with an overall trend towards warming as the carbon dioxide they emit can stay in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

### Sea-level falls

These are often clearly marked by worldwide sequences of contemporaneous sediments which show all or part of a transition from sea-bed to tidal zone to beach to dry land – and where there is no evidence that the rocks in the relevant areas were raised by geological processes such as orogeny. Sea-level falls could reduce the continental *shelf area (the most productive part of the oceans)* sufficiently to *cause a marine mass extinction*, and could *disrupt weather patterns enough to cause extinctions on land*. But sea-level falls are very probably the result of other events, such as *sustained global cooling* or the *sinking of the mid-ocean ridges*.

Sea-level falls are *associated with most of the mass extinctions,* including all of the "Big Five"—End-Ordovician, Late Devonian, End-Permian, End-Triassic, and End-Cretaceous. A 2008 study, published in the journal Nature, established a relationship between the speed of mass extinction events and changes in sea level and sediment. The study suggests changes in ocean environments related to *sea level exert a driving influence on rates of extinction, and generally determine the composition of life in the oceans*.

### Impact events

The impact of a sufficiently large **asteroid or comet** could have caused food chains to collapse both on land and at sea by *producing dust and particulate aerosols and thus inhibiting photosynthesis*. Impacts on sulfur-rich rocks could have emitted *sulfur oxides precipitating as poisonous acid rain*, contributing further to the collapse of food chains. Such impacts could also have caused *megatsunamis* and/or *global forest fires*.

Most paleontologists now agree that *an asteroid did hit the Earth about 66 Ma*, but there is an ongoing dispute whether the impact was the sole cause of the *Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event*. Nonetheless, in October 2019, researchers reported that the Cretaceous Chicxulub asteroid impact that resulted in the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs 66 Ma, also rapidly acidified the oceans producing *ecological collapse and long-lasting effects on the climate*, and was a key reason for end-Cretaceous mass extinction.

According to the **Shiva Hypothesis**, *the Earth is subject to increased asteroid impacts about once every 27 million years because of the Sun’s passage through the plane of the Milky Way galaxy, thus causing extinction events at 27 million year intervals*. Some evidence for this hypothesis has emerged in both marine and non-marine contexts. Alternatively, the Sun's passage through the higher density spiral arms of the galaxy could coincide with mass extinction on Earth, *perhaps due to increased impact events*. However, a reanalysis of the effects of the Sun's transit through the spiral structure based on CO data has failed to find a correlation.

### Global cooling

Sustained and significant **global cooling** could *kill many polar and temperate species and force others to migrate towards the equator*; reduce the area available for tropical species; often make the Earth's climate more *arid* on average, mainly by locking up more of the planet's water in ice and snow. The glaciation cycles of the current ice age are believed to have had only a very mild impact on biodiversity, so the *mere existence of a significant cooling is not sufficient on its own to explain a mass extinction*.

It has been suggested that global cooling caused or contributed to the End-Ordovician, Permian–Triassic, Late Devonian extinctions, and possibly others. Sustained global cooling is distinguished from the temporary climatic effects of flood basalt events or impacts.

### Global warming

This would have the opposite effects: 

- *expand the area available for tropical species*; 
- *kill temperate species or force them to migrate towards the poles*; 
- *possibly cause severe extinctions of polar species*; 
- often make the Earth's climate *wetter* on average, mainly by melting ice and snow and thus increasing the volume of the water cycle. 
- It might also cause anoxic events in the oceans (see below).

*Global warming as a cause of mass extinction is supported by several recent studies*. The most dramatic example of sustained warming is the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum, which was associated with one of the smaller mass extinctions. It has also been suggested to have caused the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event, during which 20% of all marine families became extinct. Furthermore, the Permian–Triassic extinction event has been suggested to have been caused by warming.
