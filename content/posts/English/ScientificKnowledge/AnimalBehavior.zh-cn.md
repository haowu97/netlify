动物行为复杂多样，各种行为都是动物对复杂环境的*适应（adaption）*表现，帮助动物更好的生存繁衍。托福中涉及到的动物行为主要可以分为：

1. 觅食行为（foraging behavior）
2. 栖息地选择（habitat selection）
3. 繁衍行为（reproductive behavior）
4. 进化（evolution）

不同的动物会有不同的行为，这些行为有简单的也有复杂的。按获得途径可分为*先天性行为（innate behavior）*和*学习行为（learned behavior）*。

## Ethology 动物行为学

Ethology is the scientific and objective study of animal behaviour, usually with a focus on behaviour under natural conditions, and viewing behaviour as an evolutionarily adaptive trait. Throughout history, different naturalists have studied aspects of animal behaviour. Ethology has its scientific roots in the work of *Charles Darwin (1809-1882)* and of American and German ornithologists （鸟类学家）of the late 19th and early 20th century. Ethology is a rapidly growing field. Since the dawn of the 21st century researchers have reexamined and reached new conclusions in many aspects of animal communication, emotions, culture, learning and sexuality that the scientific community long thought it understood.

## Foraging Behavior

觅食行为，包括搜寻，*捕食（predation）*，处理，摄取和存储食物几个阶段。是指动物从外界环境获取*营养物质（nutrition）*，以维持新陈代谢和个体生存（survive）的一种重要行为，也是其他各种行为的基础。

Foraging is searching for wild food resources. It affects an animal's fitness because it plays an important role in an animal's ability to survive and reproduce.

*TPO 7 Lecture 2*:

- Professor: As Carol said, bats use it for navigation and orientation… and what else? Mike?
- Student: Well, finding food is always important—and I guess not becoming food for other animals.
- Professor: Right, on both counts.Avoiding other predators—and locating prey—uh, typically insects that fly around at night.
- 教授:正如卡洛尔说的，蝙蝠用回声定位来导航和定位。还有别的么？麦克。
- 学生:呃，觅食是很重要的，我猜是不想成为其他动物的猎物。
- 教授:是的。两个方面都对。躲避捕猎者，定位猎物，昆虫基本都在夜间飞行。

## Habitat selection

**栖息地选择 （habitat selection）**，包括*迁徙（migration）*。栖息地是指物理和生物的环境因素的总和，包括光线、湿度、筑巢地点等，所有这些因素一起构成适宜于动物居住的某一特殊场所。它能够提供食物和防御捕食者等条件。各种动物按照自己喜爱的环境条件来选择栖息地。

In ecology, a habitat is the type of natural environment in which a particular species of organism lives. It is characterized by both physical and biological features. A species' habitat is those places where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction.

*TPO 8 Lecture 1*:

With active habitat selection, an organism is able to physically select where to live and breed. And because an animal's breeding habitat is so important, we'd expect animal species to have developed preferences for particular types of habitats, places where their offspring have the best chance of survival. And as we’ve discussed, there are some key elements that a habitat must contain: food, obviously. Water; and it’s got to have the right climate; and spaces for physical protection.

但是如果是积极的栖息地选择，生物就会在生理意义上选择它们生长繁殖的地方。并且因为动物的繁殖栖息地非常重要，我们认为动物物种倾向于选择使它们的后代有最好的生存几率的地方。正像我们讨论的，对于一个栖息地，必须包含一些关键因素:很显然有食物、水，然后还有合适的气候，以及自我保护的空间。

## Reproductive Behavior

繁衍行为是生物为延续种族所进行的产生后代的生理过程，即生物产生新的个体的过程。包括识别、占有空间、求偶、交配、孵卵、对后代的哺育等一系列的复杂行为。通常指配偶形成和交配活动的行为模式，有的科学家把动物的领地行为、筑巢行为、孵卵活动、双亲照料和其他同繁殖有联系的行为均归入其中。

Reproduction (or procreation or breeding) is the biological process by which new individual organisms –"offspring" – are produced from their "parents". Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known life; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction.

*TPO 11 Lecture 1: distraction displays*

Now if you are a bird, and there was a predator around, what are you going to do? Well, for one thing, you are going to try to attract as little attention as possible, right? Because if the predator doesn't know you are there, it's not going to try to eat you. But sometimes, certain species of birds do the exact opposite. When the predator approaches, they do their best to attract the attention of that predator.Now why would they do that? Well, they do that to draw the predator away from their nests, away from their eggs or their young birds.

现在，如果我们是鸟，而周围正有一个捕食者者，我们会做什么？首先，你会想要尽量不引起它的注意，对吗？因为捕猎者如果不知道你在那儿，就不会试着吃掉你。但有些鸟类的行为恰恰相反。当捕食者靠近的时候，它们想方设法去吸引它的注意力。为什么它们会这么做？它们这么做，是为了将捕食者从它们的巢和里面的幼鸟吸引走。

## Evolution

种群中可通过遗传物质从一代传给下一代的变化被认为是进化。生物进化可能是细微或显著的，可以依据时间长短与差异程度，分成“微观演化”（微演化）与“宏观演化”（广演化）。

1. 微观演化指几个世代中，基因频率小范围的变化，例如现今世界各地人类的差异。
2. 宏观演化指长时间的演化过程，例如人类与灭绝祖先的关系。

**Evolution** is *change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations*. These characteristics are the expressions of genes that are passed on from parent to offspring during reproduction. Different characteristics tend to exist within any given population as a result of *mutation*, *genetic recombination* and other sources of genetic variation. Evolution occurs when evolutionary processes such as natural selection (including sexual selection) and genetic drift act on this variation, resulting in certain characteristics becoming more common or rare within a population.

*TPO 20 Lecture 4*:

- And to survive in that sort of environment, animals have to adapt ... to evolve in response to their surroundings. As you'll recall, an adaptation is any feature- uh, physical or behavioral feature-of a species that helps it survive and reproduce. And in adapting to extreme climates-like Maine in the wintertime- animals can evolve in pretty interesting ways...
- So one of its adaptations is basically *camouflage*.In other words, its coat- its fur- turns from brown in the summer to white in the winter,which makes it harder for the hare's predators to see it against the white snow.
- 要在那样的环境下生活，动物们必须得进化... 随着周围环境的变化而进化。物种的进化，即在它们的行为或肢体上为在某个环境下生存和繁衍做出的改变。为了适应极端的气候地带的生存环境，譬如缅因州的冬天，动物们以各式各样的方式进化，其中有一些非常有趣。
- 所以，它最基本的一项进化就是伪装。换句话说，它的毛色，从夏天的灰色变成了冬天的白色，这使得捕食者很难从雪地里找到它。

*TPO 10 Lecture 1*:

We know whales are mammals and that they evolved from land creatures.So the mystery is figuring out how they became *ocean dwellers*. Because until recently there was no fossil record of what we call "the missing link", that is evidence of species that show the transition between land-dwelling mammals and today's whales. Fortunately, some recent fossil discoveries have made the picture a little bit clearer. For example, a few years back in Pakistan, they found a skull of a wolf-like creature.It's about fifty million years old. Scientists had seen this wolf-like creature before, but this skull was different. The ear area of the skull had characteristics seen only in aquatic mammals, specifically whales.

我们知道鲸鱼是哺乳动物，而且他们从陆地生物进化而来。所以需要解开的谜团是他们怎样变成海洋生物的。因为至今为止，我们还没有发现所谓关于二者联系消失的化石证据。这是很重要的证据来证明陆上生物到鲸鱼的进化。幸运的是最近一些化石证据能使这个“进化图”稍显清晰了。比如几年前在巴基斯坦， 发现了一具像狼一样的头盖骨距今五千万年了。科学家以为这和以前的化石一样，但事实上，它有所不同。在它耳朵区域的头骨是有水声哺乳动物的特点，特别像鲸。
