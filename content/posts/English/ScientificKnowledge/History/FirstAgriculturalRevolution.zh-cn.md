## Overview: Neolithic Revolution

### Hunting and gathering to agriculture and settlement

The **Neolithic Revolution**, or **the (First) Agricultural Revolution**, was the wide-scale transition of many human cultures during the *Neolithic period* from *a lifestyle of hunting and gathering to one of agriculture and settlement*, making an increasingly *large population possible*. These settled communities permitted humans to observe and experiment with plants to learn how they grew and developed. This new knowledge led to the *domestication of plants*.

### Happaned in separate location worldwide

Archaeological data indicates that the domestication of various types of plants and animals happened in *separate locations worldwide*, starting in the geological epoch of the Holocene 11,700 years ago. It was the world's first historically verifiable revolution in agriculture. The Neolithic Revolution *greatly narrowed the diversity of foods available*, resulting in a *downturn in the quality of human nutrition*.

## Two Important Ways

### Food-crop cultivation

The Neolithic Revolution involved far more than the adoption of a limited set of food-producing techniques. During the next millennia it transformed the small and mobile groups of hunter-gatherers that had hitherto dominated human pre-history into *sedentary (non-nomadic)* societies based in built-up villages and towns. These societies radically modified their natural environment by means of specialized food-crop cultivation, with activities such as *irrigation* and *deforestation* which allowed the production of surplus food.

### Domestication of animals

Other developments that are found very widely during this era are the *domestication of animals, pottery, polished stone tools, and rectangular houses*. In many regions, the *adoption of agriculture* by prehistoric societies caused episodes of *rapid population growth*, a phenomenon known as the *Neolithic demographic transition*.

## Two important lifestyle

### Nomadism lifestyle

Hunter-gatherers had different *subsistence requirements* and lifestyles from *agriculturalists*. They resided in temporary shelters and were highly mobile, moving in small groups and had limited contact with outsiders. Their *diet was well-balanced* and depended on what the environment provided each season.

### Settlement lifestyle

Because the *advent* of agriculture made it possible to support larger groups, agriculturalists lived in more *permanent dwellings* in areas that were *more densely populated* than could be supported by the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. The development of *trading networks* and *complex societies* brought them into contact with outside groups.

## Why agriculturalists are not health?

However, population increase did not necessarily correlate with improved health. 

- *Reliance on a single crop can adversely affect health* even while making it possible to support larger numbers of people. *Maize is deficient in certain essential amino acids (lysine and tryptophan) and is a poor source of iron*. The *phytic acid* it contains may inhibit nutrient absorption. 
- Other factors that likely affected the health of early agriculturalists and their domesticated livestock would have been *increased numbers of parasites and disease-bearing pests* associated with human waste and contaminated food and water supplies. Fertilizers and irrigation may have increased crop yields but also would have promoted *proliferation of insects and bacteria in the local environment* while *grain storage attracted additional insects and rodents*.

## What caused the Agricultural revolution?

### The Oasis Theory

The **Oasis Theory** originally proposed by Raphael Pumpelly in 1908, popularized by V. Gordon Childe in 1928 and summarised in Childe's book Man Makes Himself. 

This theory maintains that as the *climate got drier* due to the Atlantic depressions shifting northward, communities contracted to oases where they were *forced into close association with animals*, which were then domesticated together with planting of seeds. 

*However*, today this theory has *little support* amongst archaeologists because subsequent climate data suggests that *the region was getting wetter rather than drier*.

### The Stable Climate Theory

Peter Richerson, Robert Boyd, and Robert Bettinger make a case for *the development of agriculture coinciding with an increasingly stable climate* at the beginning of the Holocene. Ronald Wright's book and Massey Lecture Series A Short History of Progress popularized this hypothesis.

### Megafauna extinction Theory

The postulated Younger Dryas impact event, claimed to be in part responsible for *megafauna extinction* and *ending the last glacial period*, could have provided circumstances that required the evolution of agricultural societies for humanity to survive.

### The Demographic Theories

The Demographic theories proposed by Carl Sauer and adapted by Lewis Binford and Kent Flannery posit an *increasingly sedentary population that expanded up to the carrying capacity of the local environment and required more food than could be gathered*. Various social and economic factors helped drive the need for food.

## Four Major Ancient Grains

### Wheat

Archaeobotanical studies indicate *three species of wheat* existed in the distant past. These are Triticum sphaeococcum Pers, Triticum vulgare Vill and Triticum compactum. The first two *hexaploid species* are still cultivated in modern times, mostly in Northern India.

The *diploid species* einkorn and *tetraploid species* emmer are early wheat species. Evidence for them dates to the Bus Mordeh phase (7500 BC to 6500 BC) recovered from *excavation* at Ali Kosh in Iran and somewhat later evidence from Nea Nikomedeia. Triticum durum Desf may once have been cultivated in Ancient Egypt.

### Barley

*Along with wheat, barley (hordeum) is one of the earliest cultivated crops*. It was commonly cultivated throughout the Near East and Southern Europe in its hulled form, and the domesticated **two row species** may have originated at Beidha, Jarmo, or Ali Kosh. *Hordeum spontanneum Koch* was found at Çatal Hüyük (5850 BCE - 5600 BCE) and *Hordeum distichum Linn* at Ali Kosh (6750 BCE - 6000 BCE). In India it was mostly cultivated in the north and central regions, extending only as far south as Inamgaon and Nevasa.

### Rice

Rice is believed to have been cultivated at Non Nok Tha in **Thailand** since 3500 BC where impressions of grains of rice have been found on **potsherds**. Other cultivation sites include the Neolithic sites of Yang-Shao Ts'uan, Liu Tzuchen, Anhui, Kionsi, Chekiang and Hupei.

### Millet

The origin of **finger millet** (also called ragi) is debated with *various proposals placing* it at Abyssinia, Africa or India. Charred grains of cultivated and wild ragi have been found at the Neolithic site Hallur in southern India. Wild ragi (eleusine indica Gaertn) is known only from Songaon and Bhokardan, while the cultivated form appears at Paiyampalli in Tamilnadu, Songaon and later at Bhokardan and Nevasa in Maharashtra.
