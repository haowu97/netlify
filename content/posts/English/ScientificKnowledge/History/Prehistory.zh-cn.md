## Paleolithic Period 旧石器时代

**旧石器时代**，以使用*打制石器*为标志的人类物质文化发展阶段。从*距今约300万年前开始，延续到距今1万年左右止*。“旧石器时代”是考古学家提出来的一个时间区段概念。所谓石器时代，并不代表那个时候的人类只会使用石器。

The Paleolithic, also called the Old Stone Age, is a period in human prehistory distinguished by the original development of stone tools that covers 99% of human technological prehistory. The Paleolithic Age is characterized by the use of *knapped stone tools*, although at the time humans also used wood and bone tools.

*TPO 3 Lecture 3*:

- Now, one thing you've got to remember is the context of these paintings. 
- 现在，你们还记得的一件事是这些壁画的背景。
- Paleolithic humans - that's the period we are talking about here, the Paleolithic, the early stone age, not too long after humans first arrived in Europe. 
- 旧石器时代的人类——这就是我们现在讨论的时代。在旧石器时代早期，即人类到达欧洲后不久。
- The climate was significantly colder then, and so rock shelters - shallow caves - were valued as homes protected from the wind and rain.
- 当时的气候要比现在寒冷得多，所以岩石防空洞和浅洞窟是被当做挡风避雨的避难所。

## Neolithic Period 新石器时代

**新石器时代**是考古学家设定的一个时间区段，大约从*一万多年前开始，结束时间从距今5000多年至2000多年*，是以使用*磨制石器*为标志的人类物质文化发展阶段。据近代考古发现，在距今5000年前（新石器时代）的古人已进入了文明。考古出土的陶器、青铜、铁器、玉器、炭化纺织品残片和水稻硅质体等等文化遗存表明，几千年前古人的冶铸技术、农业、制陶、纺织业等等相当发达。

The Neolithic, also known as the “New Stone Age”, is the final division of the Stone Age. The Neolithic comprises a progression of behavioral and cultural characteristics and changes, including the use of wild and domestic crops and of domesticated animals. Not all of these cultural elements characteristic of the Neolithic appeared everywhere in the same order.

*TPO 14 Lecture 4*:

- And besides the well-known circle of massive stones of Stonehenge which, other impressive Neolithic structures are found there too. 
- 而除了巨石阵这一闻名的建筑物外，人们在英国还发现了其他的令人难忘的新石器时代建筑物。
- Oh, yes, we are talking about the Neolithic period here, also called the new Stone Age, which was the time before stone tools began to be replaced by tools made of bronze and other metals. 
- 我们这里讲的是新石器时代，该时代是在石器工具开始被由铜或其他金属工具代替之前的那段时期。
- It was about 5,000 years ago - even before the first Egyptian pyramid - that some of amazing Neolithic monuments - tombs - were erected at the various sites around Ireland, Great Britain, and coastal Islands nearby. 
- 大约是在5000 年以前，甚至是在第一个埃及金字塔之前，某一些令人惊叹的新石器时代的遗迹，坟墓，在爱尔兰、英国和附近沿海的岛屿上就已经建立起来了。

*TPO 1 Lecture 3*:

- It’s the Neolithic, remember--the late Stone Age--so the people that lived there had only stone tools--no metals. 
- 新石器时代，记住，石器时代晚期，居住在那里的人只有石器，没有金属工具。
- So everything they accomplished, like building this town, they did with just stone,... plus wood, bricks, that sort of thing.
- 他们做的每件事，诸如修建城镇，用的都是石头和木头、砖头之类的建材。
- But you got to remember that it wasn't just any stone they had, they had obsidian. And um... obsidian is a black, volcanic, well, almost like glass. It flakes very nicely into really sharp points.
- 但大家注意一点，他们所用的石头并不都是普通的石头，还有黑曜石。哦…黑曜石是一种黑色，火山岩质类似玻璃的石头。它能成片剥落而形成精致的尖角。

## The Bronze Age 青铜时代

**青铜时代**，在考古学上是以使用青铜器为标志的人类文化发展的一个阶段；因金属具有易腐蚀的特性，四五千年以上的青铜遗存发现往往为数不多。青铜时代必须具备这样一个特点：青铜器在人们的生产、生活中占据重要地位，偶然地制造和使用青铜器的时代不能认定为青铜时代。青铜是铜与锡或铅的合金。

The Bronze Age is a historical period characterized by the use of bronze, and in some areas proto-writing, and other early features of *urban civilization*. An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by producing bronze by *smelting its own copper and alloying with other metals*, or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere. Bronze itself is harder and more durable than other metals available at the time, allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage.

*TPO 50 Lecture 2*:

OK, last time we were discussing trade and commerce during the Bronze Age ...And I said a little over 3,000 years ago there was quite a *lively trade among the countries along the Mediterranean Sea people were making objects out of bronze*, and they were using bronze tools to make other goods, and they developed trade networks to trade these goods with other countries around the Mediterranean.

好，上节课我们讨论了青铜时代的贸易和商业。我还讲到了三千多年以前，地中海周围的国家之间有相当活跃的交易往来，人们用青铜制作物品，他们还使用青铜工具来制造其他的货物，他们还建造起了交易网络，以与地中海沿海的其他国家交易货物。

## The Iron Age 铁器时代

**铁器时代**是继青铜时代之后的又一个时代，它以能够冶铁和制造铁器为标志。铁器时代是丹麦考古学家Christian Jürgensen Thomsen于1836年提出的*三时代系统（Three-age System）的最后的主要时期*。地球上的天然铁是少见的，所以铁的冶炼和铁器的制造经历了一个很长的时期。

The Iron Age is the final epoch of the three-age division of the prehistory and protohistory of humanity. The duration of the Iron Age varies depending on the region under consideration. It is defined by archaeological convention, and the mere presence of some cast or wrought iron is not sufficient to represent an Iron Age culture; rather, *the "Iron Age" begins locally when the production of iron or steel has been brought to the point where iron tools and weapons superior to their bronze equivalents become widespread*.
