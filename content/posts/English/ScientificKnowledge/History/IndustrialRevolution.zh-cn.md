## Overview：Industrial Revolution

The **Industrial Revolution** was the *transition to new manufacturing processes* in *Europe and the United States*, in the period *from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840*. This transition included going *from hand production methods to machines*, *new chemical manufacturing* and *iron production processes*, the increasing *use of steam power and water power*, the development of machine tools and the rise of the *mechanized factory system*. The Industrial Revolution also led to an *unprecedented rise in the rate of population growth*.

**Textiles** were the *dominant industry* of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested. The textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods.

The Industrial Revolution marks a major **turning point in history**; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. In particular, *average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth*. Some economists have said the most important effect of the Industrial Revolution was that *the standard of living for the general population in the western world began to increase consistently* for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries.

## Requirement

**Six factors facilitated industrialization**:

1. high levels of *agricultural productivity to provide excess manpower and food*;
2. a pool of *managerial and entrepreneurial skills*;
3. available ports, rivers, canals and roads to *cheaply move raw materials and outputs*;
4. *natural resources* such as coal, iron and waterfalls;
5. *political stability and a legal system* that supported business;
6. *financial capital available* to invest.

Once industrialization began in Great Britain, new factors can be added: *the eagerness British entrepreneurs to export industrial expertise and the willingness to import the process*. Britain met the criteria and industrialized starting in the 18th century. Britain exported the process to western Europe (especially Belgium, France and the German states) in the early 19th century. The United States copied the British model in the early 19th century and Japan copied the Western European models in the late 19th century.

## Important technological development

The *commencement* of the Industrial Revolution is closely linked to a *small number of innovations*, beginning in the *second half of the 18th century.* By the 1830s the following gains had been made in important technologies:

### Textiles

Mechanised *cotton spinning* powered by steam or water increased the output of a worker by a factor of around 500. The *power loom* increased the output of a worker by a factor of over 40. The *cotton gin* increased productivity of removing seed from cotton by a factor of 50. Large gains in productivity also occurred in *spinning and weaving* of *wool and linen*, but they were not as great as in cotton.

### Steam power

*The efficiency of steam engines increased* so that they used between one-fifth and one-tenth as much fuel. The adaptation of stationary steam engines to rotary motion made them *suitable for industrial uses*. The high pressure engine had a high power to weight ratio, making it *suitable for transportation*. Steam power underwent a *rapid expansion* after 1800.

### Iron making

The *substitution of coke for charcoal* greatly *lowered the fuel cost* of *pig iron* and *wrought iron* production. Using coke also allowed larger blast furnaces, resulting in *economies of scale*. The *steam engine* began being used to pump water and to power blast air in the mid 1750s, enabling a large increase in iron production by overcoming the limitation of water power. The cast iron blowing cylinder was first used in 1760. It was later improved by making it double acting, which allowed higher blast furnace temperatures. The puddling process produced a structural grade iron at a lower cost than the finery forge. The rolling mill was fifteen times faster than hammering wrought iron. *Hot blast* (1828) greatly increased fuel efficiency in iron production in the following decades.

### Invention of machine tools

The first machine tools were invented. These included the screw cutting lathe, cylinder boring machine and the milling machine. Machine tools made the economical *manufacture of precision metal parts possible*, although it took several decades to develop effective techniques.

## Social effects

### Factory system

Prior to the Industrial Revolution, most of the workforce was employed in *agriculture*, either as self-employed farmers as *landowners or tenants*, or as *landless agricultural labourers*. It was common for families in various parts of the world to *spin yarn, weave cloth and make their own clothing*. Households also spun and wove for market production. At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution India, China and regions of Iraq and elsewhere in Asia and the Middle East produced most of the world's cotton cloth while Europeans produced wool and linen goods.

In Britain by the 16th century the putting-out system, by which farmers and townspeople produced goods for market in their homes, often described as **cottage industry**, was being practiced. Typical putting out system goods included spinning and weaving. *Merchant capitalists* typically provided the raw materials, paid workers by the piece, and were responsible for the sale of the goods.

*Embezzlement of supplies by workers* and poor quality were common problems. The *logistical effort* in *procuring* and *distributing* raw materials and picking up finished goods were also limitations of the putting out system.

The majority of textile factory workers during the Industrial Revolution were *unmarried women and children*, including many orphans. They typically worked for 12 to 14 hours per day with only Sundays off. It was common for women take factory jobs seasonally during slack periods of farm work. Lack of adequate transportation, long hours and poor pay made it difficult to recruit and maintain workers. Many workers, such as displaced farmers and agricultural workers, who had nothing but their labour to sell, became factory workers out of necessity.

### Standards of living

*Some economists*, such as Robert E. Lucas, Jr., say that the real effect of the Industrial Revolution was that "for the first time in history, the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growth ... Nothing remotely like this economic behaviour is mentioned by the classical economists, even as a theoretical possibility." 

*Others*, *however*, argue that while growth of the economy's overall productive powers was unprecedented during the Industrial Revolution, *living standards for the majority of the population did not grow meaningfully until the late 19th and 20th centuries*, and that in many ways workers' living standards declined under early capitalism: for instance, studies have shown that real wages in Britain only increased 15% between the 1780s and 1850s, and that life expectancy in Britain did not begin to dramatically increase until the 1870s. Similarly, the *average height of the population* declined during the Industrial Revolution, implying that their nutritional status was also decreasing. *Real wages* were not keeping up with the price of food.

During the Industrial Revolution, the *life expectancy of children* increased dramatically. The percentage of the children born in London who died before the age of five decreased from 74.5% in 1730–1749 to 31.8% in 1810–1829.

The effects on living conditions of the industrial revolution have been very **controversial**, and were hotly debated by economic and social historians from the 1950s to the 1980s. A series of 1950s essays by Henry Phelps Brown and Sheila V. Hopkins later set the academic *consensus that the bulk of the population, that was at the bottom of the social ladder, suffered severe reductions in their living standards*. During 1813–1913, there was a significant increase in worker wages.

### Literacy and industrialization

Modern industrialization began in England and Scotland in the 18th century, where there were *relatively high levels of literacy among farmers, especially in Scotland*. This permitted the recruitment of *literate* craftsman, skilled workers, foremen and managers who supervised the emerging textile factories and coal mines. Much of a labor was unskilled, and especially in textile mills children as young as eight proved useful in handling chores and adding to the family income. Indeed, children were taken out of school to work alongside their parents in the factories. However, by the mid-nineteenth century, unskilled labor forces were common in Western Europe, and British **industry moved upscale**, *needing many more engineers and skilled workers who could handle technical instructions and handle complex situations*. Literacy was essential to be hired.

The invention of the *paper machine and the application of steam power to the industrial processes of printing* supported a massive expansion of newspaper and pamphlet publishing, which contributed to rising literacy and demands for mass political participation.

### Population increase

The Industrial Revolution was the first period in history during which there was a *simultaneous increase in both population and per capita income*.

According to Robert Hughes in The Fatal Shore, the population of England and Wales, which had remained steady at six million from 1700 to 1740, rose dramatically after 1740. The population of England had more than doubled from 8.3 million in 1801 to 16.8 million in 1850 and, by 1901, had nearly doubled again to 30.5 million. *Improved conditions led to the population of Britain increasing from 10 million to 40 million in the 1800s*. Europe's population increased from about 100 million in 1700 to 400 million by 1900.

### Urbanization

The growth of modern industry since the late 18th century led to **massive urbanisation** and the rise of new great cities, first in Europe and then in other regions, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas. In 1800, only 3% of the world's population lived in cities, compared to nearly 50% today (the beginning of the 21st century). Manchester had a population of 10,000 in 1717, but by 1911 it had burgeoned to 2.3 million.
