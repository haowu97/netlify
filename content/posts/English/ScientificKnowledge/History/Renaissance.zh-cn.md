## Overview: Renaissance

**文艺复兴（Renaissance）**是指发生在14世纪到16世纪的一场反映新兴资产阶级要求的欧洲思想文化运动。

文艺复兴的核心是**人文主义（humanism）**，人文主义是资产阶级人道主义的最初表现。它的思想核心是资产阶级个人主义，它的理论基础是资产阶级“人性论”。

人文主义是资产阶级反对封建束缚谋取自身政治经济地位的思想武器。

文艺复兴最先在*意大利各城市兴起（如弗洛伦萨）*，以后扩展到西欧各国，于16世纪达到顶峰，带来一段科学与艺术革命时期，揭开了近代欧洲历史的序幕。

文艺复兴时期的艺术不再只服务于宗教和皇室，开始变得*世俗化(secular)*，其中出现了许多的*肖像画（portrait）*和非常精美的*壁画艺术（fresco）*。此外，文艺复兴时期的*雕塑（sculpture）*也有着显著的特点，艺术特点是以人为本，要求打破宗教束缚、解放人性，推动了科学、文化的巨大进步，有较强的启发意义。

The Renaissance was a period in European history marking **the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity** and covering the 15th and 16th centuries. *It occurred after the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages and was associated with great social change*. The traditional view focuses more on the early modern aspects of the Renaissance and argues that it was a break from the past, but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an *extension of the Middle Ages*.

The intellectual basis of the Renaissance was its version of **humanism**, derived from the concept of *Roman humanitas* and the *rediscovery of classical Greek philosophy*, such as that of Protagoras, who said that "*man is the measure of all things*." This new thinking became *manifest* in art, architecture, politics, science and literature. Early examples were the development of perspective in *oil painting* and the revived knowledge of how to *make concrete*. Although the invention of **metal movable type** sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe: the first traces appear in Italy as early as the late 13th century, in particular with the writings of Dante and the paintings of Giotto.

As a **cultural movement**, 

- the Renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of *Latin and vernacular literatures*, beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which contemporaries credited to Petrarch; 
- the development of **linear perspective** and other techniques of rendering a *more natural reality in painting*; 
- and gradual but widespread **educational reform**. 

In **politics**, the Renaissance contributed to the *development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy*, and in **science** to an increased reliance on *observation and inductive reasoning*. Although the Renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for its **artistic** developments and the contributions of such polymaths as *Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo*, who inspired the term "Renaissance man".

*In some ways, Renaissance humanism was not a philosophy but a method of learning*. In contrast to the medieval scholastic mode, which focused on resolving contradictions between authors, Renaissance humanists would study ancient texts in the original and *appraise* them through **a combination of reasoning and empirical evidence**. Humanist education was based on the programme of '*Studia Humanitatis*', the study of five humanities: poetry, grammar, history, moral philosophy and rhetoric.

## The Origins of Renaissance

Many argue that the ideas characterizing the Renaissance had their origin in **late 13th-century Florence**, in particular with the writings of *Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) and Petrarch (1304–1374), as well as the paintings of Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337)*. 

*Some writers date the Renaissance quite precisely*; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the Baptistery of the Florence Cathedral (Ghiberti won). 

Others see *more general competition* between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, and Masaccio for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of the Renaissance. 

Yet it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins.

During the Renaissance, **money and art went hand in hand**. *Artists depended entirely on patrons while the patrons needed money to foster artistic talent*. Wealth was brought to Italy in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries by expanding trade into Asia and Europe. **Silver mining** in Tyrol increased the flow of money. **Luxuries** from the Muslim world, brought home during the Crusades, increased the prosperity of Genoa and Venice.

Jules Michelet defined the 16th-century Renaissance in France as a period in Europe's cultural history that represented a break from the Middle Ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world.

### One important theory: Social and political structures in Italy

The **unique political structures** of late Middle Ages Italy have led some to theorize that its *unusual social climate* allowed the emergence of a rare cultural efflorescence. 

**Italy did not exist as a political entity** in the early modern period. Instead, it was *divided into smaller city states and territories*: the Kingdom of Naples controlled the south, the Republic of Florence and the Papal States at the center, the Milanese and the Genoese to the north and west respectively, and the Venetians to the east.

Fifteenth-century Italy was one of the **most urbanised areas in Europe**. Many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; it seems likely that the classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in the Roman Empire's heartland.

Historian and political philosopher Quentin Skinner points out that Otto of Freising (c. 1114–1158), a German bishop visiting north Italy during the 12th century, noticed a widespread new form of political and social organization, observing that Italy appeared to have **exited from Feudalism** so that its society was **based on merchants and commerce**. Linked to this was **anti-monarchical thinking**, represented in the famous early Renaissance fresco cycle The Allegory of Good and Bad Government by Ambrogio Lorenzetti (painted 1338–1340), whose strong message is about the virtues of *fairness, justice, republicanism and good administration*. *Holding both Church and Empire at bay, these city republics were devoted to notions of liberty*. Skinner reports that there were many defences of liberty such as the Matteo Palmieri (1406–1475) celebration of Florentine genius not only in art, sculpture and architecture, but "the remarkable efflorescence of moral, social and political philosophy that occurred in Florence at the same time".

Even cities and states beyond central Italy, such as the Republic of Florence at this time, were also notable for their **merchant Republics**, especially the Republic of Venice. Although in practice these were *oligarchical*, and bore little resemblance to a modern democracy, they did have *democratic features* and were responsive states, with forms of participation in governance and belief in liberty. *The relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement*.

Likewise, the position of Italian cities such as **Venice as great trading centres** made them *intellectual crossroads*. Merchants brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly the Levant. Venice was *Europe's gateway to trade* with the East, and a *producer of fine glass,* while *Florence was a capital of textiles*. *The wealth such business brought to Italy meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned and individuals had more leisure time for study.*

### Where did the name come from? 名称由来

当时的人们认为，文艺在希腊 （Greek）、罗马（Roman）古典时代曾高度繁荣，但在*中世纪“黑暗时代” （Dark Ages）*却衰败湮没，直到14世纪后才获得“再生”与“复兴”，因此称为“文艺复兴”。

第一个提出“文艺复兴”这一概念的是意大利的艺术历史学家瓦萨里（Vasari），TPO37lecture3中提到了他的著作《艺园名人传》（Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architects）。

*Figure*: 《但洛伦佐家族的“华丽”。》乔治·瓦萨里(Giorgio Vasari)

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210815153027.jpg)

TPO37 Lecture3: *Giorgio Vasari* was an Italian painter, architect and scholar. In the mid-1500s, he wrote a book called Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, in which he describes-among many other things-the features of the Mona Lisa, including her famous smile. This book drew a lot of attention to da Vinci and significantly increased the Mona Lisa's fame. As the title suggests, Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects includes *biographies* not only of da Vinci, but also of many other now-famous Italian Renaissance artists.

翻译：Vasari是一位意大利画家，建筑师和学者。在十六世纪中期，他写了一本叫做最出色的画家、雕刻家和建筑师的生活的书，在这本书里他描写了很多东西，包括蒙娜莉萨和她神秘的微笑。这本书很关注达芬奇，很大地提升了蒙娜莉萨的知名度。正如题目所指的那样，这本书包括了达芬奇及其他的著名意大利文艺复兴艺术家的传记。

## Art

文艺复兴美术三杰：

- 米开朗琪罗(Michelangelo)，代表作《最后的审判》(the last judgment)、
- 拉斐尔(Raphael)，代表作《西斯廷圣母》（Sistine Madonna）、
- 达·芬奇(Da Vinci)，代表作《蒙娜丽莎》(Mona Lisa)。

米开朗琪罗、拉斐尔和达·芬奇都是壁画大师。

| Leonardo da Vinci                                            | Michelangelo                                                 |

TPO35lecture3中提到，壁画（fresco）是文艺复兴时期绘画的重要组成部分。它在古罗马（Ancient Rome）时期就被发明，但在文艺复兴时期，壁画发展达到了顶峰。

*TPO35 Lecture3*：In our discussion of Italian Renaissance paintings from the 1400s and early 1500s, we've looked at some *masterpieces on canvas and on wood*... but our discussion would be grossly incomplete without talking about *frescoes*.

翻译：我们在讨论15世纪到16世纪早期的意大利文艺复兴的绘画时，已经看了一些画在帆布上或者画在木头上的杰作，但是如果我们不讨论壁画的话，那么我们的讨论将会是很不完整的。

文艺复兴时期的艺术，除了*宗教(religious)*风格的，也有一派艺术家崇尚*世俗(secular)*风格，例如雕塑家阿尔贝蒂(Alberti)。

在TPO45lecture1中提到，阿尔贝蒂通过解剖学的知识来让雕塑看起来很自然，让人能够感受到雕塑仿佛马上就要运动起来；阿尔贝蒂还开创了*单点线性透视法(linear one-point perspective)*，来让绘画看起来很真实，在一个二维平面上呈现出三维的质感。

TPO45 Lecture1: The Renaissance period-which started in the fourteen hundreds in Europe-the Renaissance was still a pretty religious period. And that's reflected in the artwork of that time.But artists were starting to experiment with a more secular point of view as well-a tendency to also *use the natural world as the subject matter* for their art. And there were different ways that these natural themes were explored. For instance, many artists would *paint portraits*, while others-although this was more common in northern Europe-would make *landscapes* the subject of their works.

翻译：文艺复兴时期15世纪开始于欧洲，宗教色彩还是非常浓厚的。而这反映在了当时的艺术作 品中。但是当时的艺术家们也在开始尝试一种更现世的视角，一种也使用自然的世界作为 他们艺术主题的趋势。对这些自然主题的探索有不同的方式。比如，很多艺术家会画肖像，虽然这在北欧更常见一些，但其他人会把山水作为他们作品的主题。

Renaissance art marks a *cultural rebirth* at the close of the Middle Ages and rise of the Modern world. One of the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of **highly realistic linear perspective**. Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337) is credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it was not until the demonstrations of architect Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446) and the subsequent writings of Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) that *perspective was formalized as an artistic technique*.

*Figure*: linear perspective

The development of perspective was part of a wider trend towards **realism in the arts**. Painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of Leonardo da Vinci, **human anatomy**. Underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to *depict the beauty of nature and to unravel the axioms of aesthetics*, with the works of *Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael* representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists. Other notable artists include Sandro Botticelli, working for the Medici in Florence, Donatello, another Florentine, and Titian in Venice, among others.

## Science

Applied innovation extended to commerce. At the end of the 15th century Luca Pacioli published the first work on **bookkeeping**, making him *the founder of accounting*. The *rediscovery of ancient texts and the invention of the printing press* in about 1440 democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of more widely distributed ideas. In the first period of the Italian Renaissance, humanists favoured the study of humanities over natural philosophy or applied mathematics, and their reverence for classical sources further enshrined the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic views of the universe. Writing around 1450, Nicholas Cusanus anticipated the *heliocentric worldview of Copernicus*, but in a philosophical fashion.

*Figure*: heliocentric

**Science and art were intermingled** in the early Renaissance, with polymath artists such as Leonardo da Vinci making *observational drawings of anatomy and nature*. **Da Vinci** set up *controlled experiments* in water flow, medical dissection, and systematic study of movement and aerodynamics, and he devised principles of research method that led Fritjof Capra to classify him as the "*father of modern science*". Other examples of Da Vinci's contribution during this period include machines designed to saw marbles and lift monoliths, and new discoveries in acoustics, botany, geology, anatomy, and mechanics.

*Figure*: Da Vinci

A suitable environment had developed to *question classical scientific doctrine*. The discovery in 1492 of the New World by **Christopher Columbus** challenged the classical worldview. The works of Ptolemy (in geography) and Galen (in medicine) were found to not always match everyday observations. As the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation clashed, the Northern Renaissance showed a **decisive shift** in *focus from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences* (botany, anatomy, and medicine). The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted in a period of *major scientific advancements*.

*Figure*: Christopher Columbus

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210818190450.jpg)

Another important development was in the process for discovery, the scientific method, *focusing on empirical evidence and the importance of mathematics,* while discarding much of Aristotelian science. Early and influential proponents of these ideas included *Copernicus, Galileo, and Francis Bacon*. The new scientific method led to great contributions in the fields of astronomy, physics, biology, and anatomy.

## Literature

文学三杰分别是

1. 但丁(Alighieri Dante)，代表作《神曲（Divine Comedy）》；
2. 皮特拉克(Petrarch)
3. 薄伽丘(Giovanni Boccàccio)。

这时期欧洲的人文主义文学具有鲜明的民族特点，更富于民族历史内容，充满爱国情绪。人文主义作家*抛弃了中世纪以来著书立说所惯用的拉丁文，采用各自的民族语言进行写作*，这既使文学作品具有了民族的形式和民族的风格，为广大人民群众所接受，又对近代各民族国家的形成和稳定产生了积极影响。

在创作方法上，人文主义作家十分*注重写实*，人文主义作家们描述了*广阔的社会生活*，创造了一系列不朽的艺术形象，丰富了欧洲文学的现实主义传统。

## Music

西方音乐史上的复调音乐全盛时期，主要音乐体裁是世俗歌谣曲，有*意大利的牧歌(madrigae)*，*法国的尚颂(Chanson)*，*德国的里德(lied)*，*英国的康索尔特歌(Consort)*。

以及这个时期古钢琴的使用包括*羽管键琴（harpsicord）*和*击弦键琴（clavicord）*。

人们不再盲从与古典音乐，而是提供了理性的根据。随后工业技术的发展，使得音乐有了更大的变化。

新的题材出现，抒发了人文主义的情感，更加清新。音乐也不再受到宗教礼仪的束缚。

From this changing society emerged a **common, unifying musical language**, in particular the polyphonic style of the Franco-Flemish school. *The development of printing made distribution of music possible on a wide scale*. Demand for music as entertainment and as an activity for *educated amateurs* increased with the emergence of a *bourgeois class*. *Dissemination* of chansons, motets, and masses throughout Europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style that *culminated* in the second half of the sixteenth century in the work of composers such as Palestrina, Lassus, Victoria and William Byrd.
