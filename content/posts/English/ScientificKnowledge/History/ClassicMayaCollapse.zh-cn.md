In archaeology, the **classic Maya collapse** is the *decline of the Classic Maya civilization* and the *abandonment of Maya cities* in the southern Maya lowlands of Mesoamerica between the *8th and 9th centuries*, at the end of the *Classic Maya Period*. The Preclassic Maya experienced a similar collapse in the 2nd century.

## Overview: Classic Maya Collapse

### Three important period for Maya civilization

Timeline:

1. Preclassic Period 前古典期
2. Classic Period 古典期
3. Classic Maya Collapse
4. Postclassic Period 后古典期

The *Classic Period of Mesoamerican* chronology is generally defined as the period from 250 to 900 CE, the last century of which is referred to as the *Terminal Classic*. The **Classic Maya collapse** is one of the greatest *unsolved mysteries in archaeology*. Urban centers of the southern lowlands, among them Palenque, Copán, Tikal, and Calakmul, went into decline during the 8th and 9th centuries and were abandoned shortly thereafter.

Archaeologically, this decline is indicated by the *cessation of monumental inscriptions* and the *reduction of large-scale architectural construction* at the primary urban centers of the Classic Period.

*Key words*: southern Maya lowlands, Urban centers, monumental inscriptions.

### Some common misconceptions

Although termed a *collapse, it did not mark the end* of the Maya civilization but rather a *shift away from the Southern Lowlands* as a power center; the *Northern Yucatán in particular prospered afterwards*, although with very different artistic and architectural styles, and with much *less use of monumental hieroglyphic writing*. In the Post-Classic Period following the collapse, the state of Chichén Itzá built an empire that briefly united much of the Maya region, and centers such as Mayapán and Uxmal flourished, as did the Highland states of the Kʼicheʼ and Kaqchikel Maya. *Independent Maya civilization continued until 1697* when the Spanish conquered Nojpetén, the last independent city-state. Millions of Maya people still inhabit the Yucatán peninsula today.

### Attitudes of some scholars:

Because parts of Maya civilization *unambiguously continued*, a number of scholars strongly *dislike the term collapse*. Regarding the proposed collapse, E. W. Andrews IV went as far as to say, "in my belief no such thing happened."

*Key words*: shift away, Northern Yucatán, different.

## Three important evidences

### Monuments

The Maya often recorded dates on monuments they built. *Few dated monuments* were being built circa 500 – around ten per year in 514, for example. The number steadily increased to twenty per year by 672 and forty by around 750. After this, the number of dated monuments begins to *falter* relatively quickly, collapsing back to ten by 800 and to zero by 900.

### Recorded lists of kings

Likewise, *recorded lists of kings* complement this analysis. Altar Q at Copán shows a reign of kings from 426 to 763. One last king not recorded on Altar Q was Ukit Took, "Patron of Flint", who was probably a *usurper*. The dynasty is believed to have collapsed entirely shortly thereafter. In Quirigua, twenty miles north of Copán, the last king Jade Sky began his rule between 895 and 900, and throughout the Maya area all kingdoms *similarly fell around that time*.

### Obsidian hydration

A third piece of evidence of the progression of Maya decline, gathered by Ann Corinne Freter, Nancy Gonlin, and David Webster, uses a technique called **obsidian hydration**. The technique allowed them to map the spread and growth of settlements in the Copán Valley and *estimate their populations*. Between 400 and 450, the population was estimated at a peak of twenty-eight thousand, between 750 and 800 – larger than London at the time. Population then began to steadily decline. By 900 the population had fallen to fifteen thousand, and by 1200 the population was again less than 1000.

## What caused the collapse of the Mayan civilization？

Over 80 different theories or variations of theories attempting to explain the Classic Maya collapse have been identified. From *climate change to deforestation* to *lack of action by Maya kings*, there is *no universally accepted collapse theory*, although *drought* has gained momentum in the first quarter of the 21st century as the leading explanation, as more scientific studies are conducted.

Four Main Theories:

### Foreign invasion

The archaeological evidence of the *Toltec intrusion* into Seibal, Peten, suggests to some the theory of **foreign invasion**. The latest hypothesis states that the southern lowlands were invaded by a non-Maya group whose homelands were probably in the gulf coast lowlands. This invasion *began in the 9th century and set off, within 100 years*, a group of events that destroyed the Classic Maya. It is believed that this invasion was somehow influenced by the Toltec people of central Mexico. *However*, most Mayanists do not believe that foreign invasion was the main cause of the Classic Maya collapse; they postulate that *no military defeat can explain or be the cause of the protracted and complex Classic collapse process*. Teotihuacan influence across the Maya region may have involved some form of military invasion; however, it is generally noted that significant Teotihuacan-Maya interactions date from at least the Early Classic period, well before the episodes of Late Classic collapse.

*Key words*: foreign invasion, Toltec intrusion, protracted and complex.

The foreign invasion theory does not answer the question of *where the inhabitants went*. David Webster believed that the population should have increased because of the lack of elite power. Further, it is not understood *why the governmental institutions were not remade following the revolts*, which happened under similar circumstances in places like China. A study by anthropologist Elliot M. Abrams came to the conclusion that buildings, specifically in Copan, did not require an extensive amount of time and workers to construct. However, this theory was developed during a period when the archaeological evidence showed that there were fewer Maya people than there are now known to have been. *Revolutions, peasant revolts, and social turmoil* change circumstances, and are often followed by foreign wars, but they run their course. *There are no documented revolutions* that caused wholesale abandonment of entire regions.

*Key words*: inhabitants went, elite power, social turmoil.

### Collapse of trade routes

It has been hypothesized that the decline of the Maya is related to the **collapse of their intricate trade systems**, especially those connected to the central Mexican city of *Teotihuacán*. Preceding improved knowledge of the chronology of Mesoamerica, *Teotihuacan was believed to have fallen during 700–750, forcing the "restructuring of economic relations throughout highland Mesoamerica and the Gulf Coast"*. This remaking of relationships between civilizations would have then given the collapse of the Classic Maya a slightly later date. **However**, after researchers learned more about the events and the periods when they occurred, it is believed that the strongest Teotihuacan influence was during the 4th and 5th centuries. In addition, the civilization of Teotihuacan started to lose its power, and maybe abandoned the city, during 600–650. This differs greatly from the previous belief that Teotihuacano power decreased during 700–750. *But since the new decline date of 600–650 has been accepted, the Maya civilizations are now thought to have lived on and prospered "for another century and more"than what was previously believed*.

*Key words*: intricate trade systems, Teotihuacan.

### Epidemic diseases

The **disease theory** is also a *contender* as a factor in the Classic Maya collapse. Widespread disease could explain some rapid *depopulation*, both directly through the spread of infection itself and indirectly as an inhibition to recovery over the long run. According to Dunn (1968) and Shimkin (1973), infectious diseases spread by *parasites* are common in tropical rainforest regions, such as the Maya lowlands. Shimkin specifically suggests that the Maya may have encountered endemic infections related to American trypanosomiasis, Ascaris, and some enteropathogens that cause *acute diarrheal illness*. Furthermore, some experts believe that, through development of their civilization (that is, development of agriculture and settlements), the Maya could have created a "disturbed environment", in which *parasitic and pathogen-carrying insects* often thrive.

Among the *pathogens* listed above, it is thought that those that cause the *acute diarrheal illnesses* would have been the most devastating to the Maya population, because such illness would have struck a victim at an early age, thereby *hampering nutritional health and the natural growth and development of a child*. This would have made them more susceptible to other diseases later in life, and would have been exacerbated by an increasing dependence on *carbohydrate-rich crops*. Such ideas as this could explain the role of disease as at least a possible partial reason for the Classic Maya Collapse.

*Key words*: disease theory, rapid depopulation, acute diarrheal illnesses.

### Drought theory

The **drought theory** holds that rapid climate change in the form of severe drought (a megadrought) brought about the Classic Maya collapse. *Paleoclimatologists* have discovered abundant evidence that *prolonged droughts* occurred in the Yucatán Peninsula and Petén Basin areas during the Terminal Classic. Large droughts likely caused a *decline in agricultural fertility* due to regular seasonal drought drying up surface waters, as well as causing *thin tropical soils to erode* when deprived of vegetation and forest cover.

Climatic factors were first implicated in the collapse as early as 1931 by Mayanists Thomas Gann and J. E. S. Thompson. In 1995, Hodell, Curtis and Brenner published a paleoclimate record from Lake Chichancanab on the Yucatán Peninsula that showed *an intense, protracted drought occurred in the 9th century AD* and coincided with the Classic Maya collapse. In The Great Maya Droughts, Richardson Gill gathered and analyzed an array of climatic, historical, hydrologic, tree ring, volcanic, geologic, and archeological research, and suggested that a prolonged series of droughts likely caused the Classic Maya collapse. The drought theory provides a comprehensive explanation, because *non-environmental and cultural factors (excessive warfare, foreign invasion, peasant revolt, less trade, etc.) can all be explained by the effects of prolonged drought on Classic Maya civilization*.

The role of drought in the collapse of Classic Maya civilization has remained *controversial*, however, largely because the majority of paleoclimate records only provide qualitative data, for example whether conditions were simply "wetter" or "drier". The *lack of quantitative data* makes it difficult to predict how climatic changes would have affected human populations and the environment in which they lived.

*Key words*: prolonged droughts, agricultural fertility, tree ring, controversial.
