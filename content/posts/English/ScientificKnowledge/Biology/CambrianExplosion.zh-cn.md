## Overview

The **Cambrian explosion** was an event approximately 541 million years ago in the *Cambrian period* when practically **all major animal phyla started appearing** in the fossil record. It lasted for about 13 – 25 million years and resulted in the *divergence* of most modern metazoan phyla. The event was accompanied by major diversification of other organisms.

Before the Cambrian explosion, most organisms were simple, composed of individual cells, or small multi-celled organisms, occasionally organized into colonies. As the *rate of diversification subsequently accelerated, the variety of life began to resemble that of today*. Almost all present animal phyla appeared during this period.

## History and Significance

The seemingly rapid appearance of fossils in the "Primordial Strata" was noted by William Buckland in the 1840s, and in his 1859 book 《On the Origin of Species》,*Charles Darwin* discussed the inexplicable lack of earlier fossils as one of the **main difficulties for his theory of descent with slow modification through natural selection**. The long-running puzzlement about the appearance of the Cambrian fauna, seemingly *abruptly, without precursor*, centers on three key points:

1. Whether there really was a mass diversification of complex organisms over a relatively short period of time during the early Cambrian?
2. What might have caused such rapid change?
3. What it would imply about the origin of animal life.

*Interpretation is difficult due to a limited supply of evidence*, based mainly on an incomplete fossil record and chemical signatures remaining in Cambrian rocks.

“To the question why we do not find rich fossiliferous deposits belonging to these assumed earliest periods prior to the Cambrian system, I can give no satisfactory answer.” --- Darwin （物种进化论难以解释的大爆发）

## Explanation of key scientific terms

A **phylum** is the highest level in the **Linnaean system** for classifying organisms. Phyla can be thought of as groupings of animals based on general body plan. Despite the seemingly different external appearances of organisms, they are classified into phyla based on their *internal and developmental organizations*. For example, despite their obvious differences, spiders and barnacles both belong to the phylum Arthropoda, but earthworms and tapeworms, although similar in shape, belong to different phyla. As chemical and genetic testing becomes more accurate, *previously hypothesised phyla are often entirely reworked*.

A phylum is not a fundamental division of nature, such as the difference between electrons and protons. It is simply a very high-level grouping in a classification system created to describe all currently living organisms. This system is **imperfect**, *even for modern animals: different books quote different numbers of phyla*, mainly because they disagree about the classification of a huge number of worm-like species. As it is based on living organisms, it accommodates extinct organisms poorly, if at all.

## What might have caused such rapid change?

Despite the evidence that *moderately complex animals* (triploblastic bilaterians) existed before and possibly long before the start of the Cambrian, it seems that the **pace of evolution was exceptionally fast in the early Cambrian**. *Possible explanations* for this fall into three broad categories:

- environmental
- developmental
- ecological changes

Any explanation must explain both the *timing and magnitude* of the explosion.

### Changes in the environment

#### Increase in oxygen levels

Earth's earliest atmosphere contained no free oxygen (O2); the oxygen that animals breathe today, both in the air and dissolved in water, is the product of billions of years of **photosynthesis**. **Cyanobacteria** were the first organisms to evolve the ability to photosynthesize, introducing a steady supply of oxygen into the environment.

Initially, oxygen levels did not increase substantially in the atmosphere. The oxygen quickly reacted with iron and other minerals in the surrounding rock and ocean water. Once a *saturation* point was reached for the reactions in rock and water, oxygen was able to exist as a gas in its diatomic form. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere increased substantially afterward. As a general trend, the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere has risen gradually over about the last 2.5 billion years.

*Oxygen levels seem to have a positive correlation with diversity in* **eukaryotes** well before the Cambrian period. The last common ancestor of all extant eukaryotes is thought to have lived around 1.8 billion years ago. Around *800 million years ago*, there was a notable increase in the complexity and number of eukaryotes species in the fossil record. Before the *spike* in diversity, eukaryotes are thought to have lived in highly sulfuric environments. Sulfide interferes with *mitochondrial function* in aerobic organisms, limiting the amount of oxygen that could be used to *drive metabolism*. Oceanic sulfide levels decreased around 800 million years ago, which supports the importance of oxygen in eukaryotic diversity.

**The shortage of oxygen might well have prevented the rise of large, complex animals**. The amount of oxygen an animal can absorb is largely determined by the area of its *oxygen-absorbing surfaces* (lungs and gills in the most complex animals; the skin in less complex ones); but, *the amount needed is determined by its volume*, which grows faster than the oxygen-absorbing area if an animal's size increases equally in all directions. An increase in the concentration of oxygen in air or water would increase the size to which an organism could grow without its tissues becoming starved of oxygen. However, animals were not affected when similar oceanographic conditions occurred in the Phanerozoic; *there is no convincing correlation between oxygen levels and evolution*, so oxygen may have been no more a prerequisite to complex life than liquid water or primary productivity.

#### Increase in the calcium concentration of the Cambrian seawater

Newer research suggests that *volcanically active midocean ridges* caused a **massive and sudden surge of the calcium concentration** in the oceans, making it possible for marine organisms to *build skeletons and hard body parts*. An increase of calcium may also have been caused by erosion of the Transgondwanan Supermountain that existed at the time of the explosion. The roots of the mountain are preserved in present-day East Africa as an orogen.

### Developmental explanations

A range of theories are based on the concept that minor modifications to animals' development as they grow *from embryo to adult* may have been able to cause very large changes in the final adult form. The *Hox genes*, for example, *control which organs individual regions of an embryo will develop into*. For instance, if a certain Hox gene is expressed, a region will develop into a limb; if a different Hox gene is expressed in that region (a minor change), it could develop into an eye instead (a phenotypically major change).

Such a system allows a large range of disparity to appear from a limited set of genes, *but such theories linking this with the explosion struggle to explain why the origin of such a development system should by itself lead to increased diversity or disparity.* Evidence of Precambrian metazoans combines with molecular data to show that much of the genetic architecture that could feasibly have played a role in the explosion was already well established by the Cambrian.

**Horizontal gene transfer** has also been identified as a possible factor in the rapid acquisition of the biochemical capability of biomineralization among organisms during this period, based on evidence that the gene for a critical protein in the process was originally transferred from a bacterium into sponges.

### Ecological explanations

These focus on the interactions between different types of organism. Some of these hypotheses deal with changes in the **food chain**; some suggest **arms races between predators and prey**, and others focus on the more general mechanisms of **coevolution**. *Such theories are well suited to explaining why there was a rapid increase in both disparity and diversity, but they do not explain why the "explosion" happened when it did.*

#### Arms races between predators and prey

The ability to avoid or recover from predation often makes the difference between life and death, and is therefore one of the strongest components of **natural selection**. The pressure to adapt is stronger on the prey than on the predator: if the predator fails to win a contest, it loses a meal; if the prey is the loser, it loses its life.

But, there is evidence that **predation was rife long before the start of the Cambrian**, for example in the increasingly spiny forms of acritarchs, the holes drilled in Cloudina shells, and traces of burrowing to avoid predators. Hence, **it is unlikely that the appearance of predation was the trigger for the Cambrian "explosion"**, although it may well have exhibited a strong influence on the body forms that the "explosion" produced. *However*, *the intensity of predation does appear to have increased dramatically during the Cambrian as new predatory "tactics" (such as shell-crushing) emerged*. This rise of predation during the Cambrian was confirmed by the temporal pattern of the median predator ratio at the scale of genus, in fossil communities covering the Cambrian and Ordovician periods, but this pattern is not correlated to diversification rate. This lack of correlation between predator ratio and diversification over the Cambrian and Ordovician suggests that **predators did not trigger the large evolutionary radiation of animals during this interval**. *Thus the role of predators as triggerers of diversification may have been limited to the very beginning of the "Cambrian explosion"*.
