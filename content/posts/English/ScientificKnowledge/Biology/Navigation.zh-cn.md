生物学中Navigation Methods，是**托福阅读和听力生物类**常考的话题背景，**主要需要搞懂几种常见的导航方式**。

## Overview

**Animal navigation** is the ability of many animals to **find their way** accurately without maps or instruments. **Birds** such as the Arctic tern, **insects** such as the monarch butterfly and **fish** such as the salmon regularly **migrate** thousands of miles to and from their **breeding grounds**, and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances.

**Five Common Methods**:

1. **By the sun**
2. **By the landmarks**
3. **By the magnetic field**
4. **By the night sky/ star**
5. **By olfaction**

Several species of animal can **integrate cues** of different types to orient themselves and navigate effectively. Insects and birds are able to **combine** **learned landmarks** with sensed direction (from the earth's **magnetic field** or from the **sky**) to identify where they are and so to navigate. **Internal 'maps'** are often formed using **vision**, but other senses including **olfaction** and **echolocation** may also be used.

## History

Dead reckoning, navigating from a known position using only information about one's own speed and direction, was suggested by **Charles Darwin** in 1873 as a possible mechanism. 

In the 20th century, Karl von Frisch showed that **honey bees** can navigate **by the sun**, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's **magnetic field**; of these, they rely on the sun when possible. 

William Tinsley Keeton showed that **homing pigeons** could similarly make use of a range of **navigational cues**, including the sun, earth's magnetic field, **olfaction** and vision. 

Ronald Lockley demonstrated that a **small seabird**, the Manx shearwater, could **orient** itself and fly home at full speed, when released far from home, provided either the sun or the stars were visible.

## Methods

### Remembered landmarks

Animals including **mammals**, birds and insects such as **bees** and **wasps** (Ammophila and Sphex), are capable of learning landmarks in their environment, and of using these in navigation.

### Orientation by the sun

Some animals can navigate using **celestial cues** such as the position of the sun. Since the sun moves in the sky, navigation by this means also requires an **internal clock**. Many animals depend on such a clock to maintain their **circadian rhythm**. Animals that use **sun compass** orientation are *fish, birds, sea-turtles, butterflies, bees, sandhoppers, reptiles, and ants.*

When sandhoppers (such as Talitrus saltator) are taken up a beach, they *easily find their way back down to the sea*. It has been shown that this is not simply by moving downhill or towards the sight or sound of the sea. A group of sandhoppers were **acclimatised** to **a day/night cycle** under artificial lighting, whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers were placed on the beach **in natural sunlight.** *They moved away from the sea*, up the beach. The experiment implied that the sandhoppers use the *sun and their internal clock* to determine their heading, and that they had learnt the actual direction down to the sea on their particular beach.

### Orientation by the night sky

In a **pioneering experiment**, Lockley showed that warblers placed in a **planetarium** showing the night sky oriented themselves towards the south; when the planetarium sky was then very slowly rotated, the birds maintained their orientation with respect to the displayed stars. Lockley observes that to navigate by the stars, birds would need both a "*sextant and chronometer*": a built-in ability to read patterns of stars and to navigate by them, which also requires an accurate **time-of-day clock.**

In 2003, the African dung beetle Scarabaeus zambesianus was shown to navigate using **polarization patterns** in moonlight, making it the first animal known to use polarized moonlight for orientation. In 2013, it was shown that dung beetles can navigate when only the **Milky Way** or **clusters of bright stars** are visible, making dung beetles the only insects known to orient themselves by the **galaxy**.

### Orientation by polarised light

Some animals, notably insects such as the **honey bee**, are sensitive to the **polarisation of light**. Honey bees can use **polarized light** on **overcast days** to estimate the position of the sun in the sky, relative to the compass direction they intend to travel. Karl von Frisch's work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from the **hive** to a food source (typically a patch of nectar-bearing flowers). A worker bee returns to the hive and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a **waggle dance**. The observing bees are then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction, though other biologists have questioned whether they necessarily do so, or are simply stimulated to go and search for food. However, bees are certainly able to remember the location of food, and to navigate back to it accurately, whether the weather is sunny (in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks) or largely *overcast (when polarised light may be used)*.

### Magnetoreception

Some animals, including mammals such as **blind mole rats** (Spalax) and birds such as **pigeons**, are sensitive to the earth's **magnetic field.**

**Homing pigeons** use magnetic field information with other navigational cues. Pioneering researcher William Keeton showed that time-shifted homing pigeons *could not orient themselves correctly on a clear sunny day, but could do so on an overcast day*, suggesting that the birds prefer to rely on the direction of the sun, but switch to using a magnetic field cue when the sun is not visible. This was confirmed by experiments with magnets: the pigeons could not orient correctly on an overcast day when the magnetic field was **disrupted**.

### Olfaction

**Olfactory navigation** has been suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a **mental map** of the **odours** in their area, recognizing where they are by the local odour. Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues that there is a steady, large-scale **gradient of odour** which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the **intensities of the odours**. **However** it is not clear that such stable gradients exist. Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation. *However, it is not clear how olfactory cues are used.*

Olfactory cues may be important in **salmon**, which are known to return to the exact river where they **hatched**. Lockley reports experimental evidence that fish such as minnows can accurately tell the difference between the waters of different rivers. Salmon may use their **magnetic sense** to navigate to within reach of their river, and then use **olfaction** to identify the river at close range.
