## Overview: Symbiosis

**Symbiosis** is any type of a *close and long-term biological interaction between two different biological organisms*, be it mutualistic, commensalistic, or parasitic. The organisms, each termed a *symbiont*, must be of different species. In 1879, Heinrich Anton de Bary defined it as "the living together of unlike organisms". The term was subject to a century-long debate about whether it should *specifically denote mutualism*, as in lichens. Biologists have now *abandoned that restriction*.

Symbiosis can be 

- *obligatory*, which means that one or more of the symbionts entirely depend on each other for survival, 
- or *facultative* (optional), when they can generally live independently.

### History of Definition

The definition of symbiosis was a matter of *debate* for 130 years. 

In 1877, Albert Bernhard Frank used the term symbiosis to describe the *mutualistic relationship in lichens*. 

In 1878, the German mycologist Heinrich Anton de Bary defined it as "the living together of unlike organisms". 

The definition has varied among scientists, with some advocating that it should *only refer to persistent mutualisms*, while others thought it should apply to *all persistent biological interactions* (in other words, to mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism, but excluding brief interactions such as predation). 

In the 21st century, the latter has become the definition widely accepted by biologists.

## Three major relationship

### Mutualism

**Mutualism** is a long-term relationship between individuals of different species where *both individuals benefit*. Mutualistic relationships may be either *obligate* for both species, obligate for one but *facultative* for the other, or facultative for both.

- A large percentage of *herbivores* have mutualistic *gut flora* to help them digest plant matter, which is more difficult to digest than animal prey. This gut flora is made up of cellulose-digesting protozoans or bacteria living in the herbivores' intestines. 
- *Coral reefs* are the result of mutualism between *coral organisms* and various types of *algae* which live inside them. 
- Most land plants and land ecosystems rely on mutualism between *the plants, which fix carbon from the air*, and *mycorrhyzal fungi, which help in extracting water and minerals from the ground*.

An example of mutualism is the relationship between the *ocellaris clownfish* that *dwell among the tentacles of Ritteri sea anemones*. The territorial fish protects the anemone from anemone-eating fish, and in turn the stinging tentacles of the anemone protect the clownfish from its predators. A special mucus on the clownfish protects it from the stinging tentacles.

Many types of tropical and sub-tropical ants have evolved very complex relationships with certain tree species.

### Commensalism

**Commensalism** describes a relationship between two living organisms where *one benefits and the other is not significantly harmed or helped*. It is derived from the English word commensal, used of human social interaction. It derives from a medieval Latin word meaning sharing food, formed from com- (with) and mensa (table).

Commensal relationships may involve one organism using another for *transportation* (phoresy) or for *housing* (inquilinism), or it may also involve one organism using something another created, after its death (metabiosis). Examples of metabiosis are *hermit crabs* using gastropod shells to protect their bodies, and *spiders* building their webs on plants.

### Parasitism

In a **parasitic relationship**, *the parasite benefits* while *the host is harmed*. Parasitism takes many forms, from *endoparasites* that live within the host's body to *ectoparasites* and *parasitic castrators* that live on its surface and *micropredators* like mosquitoes that visit intermittently.

Parasitism is an extremely successful mode of life; *about 40% of all animal species are parasites*, and the average mammal species is host to 4 nematodes, 2 cestodes, and 2 trematodes.
