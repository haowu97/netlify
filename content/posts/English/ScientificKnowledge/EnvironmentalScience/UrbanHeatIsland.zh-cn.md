## Overview

An **urban heat island (UHI)** is an *urban area or metropolitan area that is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas due to human activities*. The temperature difference is usually larger at night than during the day, and is most apparent when winds are weak. UHI is most noticeable during the summer and winter. The main cause of the urban heat island effect is from the *modification of land surfaces*. *Waste heat generated* by energy usage is a secondary contributor. As a population center grows, it tends to expand its area and increase its average temperature. The term heat island is also used; the term can be used to refer to any area that is relatively hotter than the surrounding, but generally refers to human-disturbed areas.

*Monthly rainfall* is greater downwind of cities, partially due to the UHI. Increases in heat within urban centers *increases the length of growing seasons and decreases the occurrence of weak tornadoes*. The UHI *decreases air quality* by increasing the production of pollutants such as ozone, and *decreases water quality* as warmer waters flow into area streams and put stress on their ecosystems.

## Causes

There are several **causes of an urban heat island (UHI)**:

1. **Dark surfaces absorb significantly more solar radiation**, which causes urban concentrations of roads and buildings to heat more than suburban and rural areas during the day.

2. Materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs, such as concrete and asphalt, have significantly different **thermal bulk properties** (including *heat capacity and thermal conductivity*) and **surface radiative properties** (*albedo and emissivity*) than the surrounding rural areas. This causes a change in the energy budget of the urban area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas.
3. Another major reason is the **lack of evapotranspiration** (for example, through lack of vegetation) in urban areas. The U.S. Forest Service found in 2018 that cities in the United States are losing 36 million trees each year. With a decreased amount of vegetation, cities also lose the shade and evaporative cooling effect of trees.

4. Other causes of a UHI are due to geometric effects. The tall buildings within many urban areas provide *multiple surfaces for the reflection and absorption of sunlight*, increasing the efficiency with which urban areas are heated. This is called the "**urban canyon effect**".

5. Another effect of buildings is **the blocking of wind**, which also inhibits cooling by convection and prevents pollutants from dissipating. **Waste heat** from automobiles, air conditioning, industry, and other sources also contributes to the UHI.
6. **High levels of pollution** in urban areas can also increase the UHI, as many forms of pollution change *the radiative properties* of the atmosphere. UHI not only raises urban temperatures but also increases ozone concentrations because *ozone is a greenhouse gas* whose formation will accelerate with the increase of temperature.

## Diurnal behavior

It is well-known that compared to non-urban areas *urban heat islands raise night-time temperatures more than daytime temperatures*. Besides, the air temperature difference between the UHI and the surrounding environment is large at night and small during the day.

### Daytime

Throughout the daytime, particularly when the skies are cloudless, urban surfaces are warmed by the absorption of solar radiation. *Surfaces in the urban areas tend to warm faster than those of the surrounding rural areas*. By virtue of their high heat capacities, *urban surfaces act as a giant reservoir of heat energy*. For example, concrete can hold roughly 2,000 times as much heat as an equivalent volume of air. As a result, the large daytime surface temperature within the UHI is easily seen via thermal remote sensing. As is often the case with daytime heating, this warming also has the effect of generating **convective winds** within the urban boundary layer. It is theorized that, due to the atmospheric mixing that results, the air temperature perturbation within the UHI is generally minimal or nonexistent during the day, though the surface temperatures can reach extremely high levels.

### Night

At night, the situation reverses. The absence of solar heating leads to the *decrease of atmospheric convection* and the stabilization of urban boundary layer. If enough stabilization occurs, an *inversion layer is formed*. This traps urban air near the surface, and keeping surface air warm from the still-warm urban surfaces, resulting in warmer nighttime air temperatures within the UHI. Other than the heat retention properties of urban areas, the nighttime maximum in urban canyons could also be due to the blocking of "sky view" during cooling: surfaces lose heat at night principally by radiation to the comparatively cool sky, and this is *blocked by the buildings* in an urban area. Radiative cooling is more dominant when wind speed is low and the sky is cloudless, and indeed the UHI is found to be largest at night in these conditions.
