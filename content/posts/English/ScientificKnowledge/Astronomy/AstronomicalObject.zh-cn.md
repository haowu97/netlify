天文学的内容可以考的很多，每颗星球都有独特的特征，宇宙奥秘无穷；

了解这些天文学的基本常识的目的也不是去准确记住这些星球的内外顺序，具体特征，而是希望大家有这个**“宇宙系统观”**；

若我们能在了解宇宙基本架构后去理解文章的信息，那么读文章时自然读起来更形象，更顺畅，答题也就更轻松了。

## 宇宙（universe，cosmos）

宇宙里面有**星系（galaxy）**，比如我们太阳系所处的**银河系（Milky Way）**

银河系里有我们所处的**太阳系（the solar system）**

### 宇宙的起源

**大爆炸理论Big Bang theory：**宇宙由一个密度无限大的*奇点（a single point）*爆炸炸出来，形成了星系和我们的宇宙。

## 太阳系（the solar system）

太阳系是以太阳为中心，和所有受到太阳的引力约束天体的集合体，天体处在一个**光盘状平面（a flat disk）**做**轨道运动（orbit），**所有行星绕太阳运动且方向一致。

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210817094119.jpg)

**恒星（star，形容词stellar）**：恒星是由引力凝聚在一起的一颗球型发光等离子体，比如**太阳（the sun）。**

**行星（planets）**：环绕着恒星**公转（revolve**）的天体。自己会**自转（rotate）**

- 比如八大行星：按照和太阳的距离，它们依次为*水星（Mercury，离太阳近，好热啊）、金星（Venus，和地球最像，但是还是好热）、地球（Earth，一个字，爽）、火星（Mars，好多火山，好像有水？！）、木星（Jupiter，哇，它最大！）、土星（Saturn，最美，有土星环）、天王星（Uranus，不是最远但是最冷！）、海王星（Neptune，距离产生美）。*
    - 这八颗行星被分为**类地行星（terrestrial planets）**：水星（Mercury）、金星（Venus）、地球（Earth）、火星（Mars）：（类地行星是与地球相类似的行星。它们距离太阳近，体积和质量都较小，平均密度较大，表面温度较高，大小与地球差不多，也都是由岩石构成的。）
    - 与**类木行星（Jovian planet）**：木星（Jupiter）、土星（Saturn）、天王星（Uranus）、海王星（Neptune）。（在木星之外的行星是不以岩石或其他固体为主要成分构成的大行星。木星和土星体积巨大，质量也大，但密度小，主要由氢、氦、氖等轻元素组成）
- 被除名的地九行星**冥王星（Pluto，小，冷，暗，不带你了）**

**卫星（satellites）**：卫星是指在围绕一颗行星轨道行星运行的天体，比如绕着地球转的*月球（the moon）*

还有托福阅读常考的**小行星（asteroid）**：小行星是太阳系形成后的物质残余。就是没有能够形成行星的石头，通俗点说就是**“边角料”。**

- 比如**谷神星（Ceres）：**曾被认为是太阳系已知最大的小行星。（看看上图那个还蛮大的吧）

**小行星带（asteroid belt）：**太阳系内介于火星和木星轨道之间的小行星密集区域，也就是边角料集中带。

**彗星（comet）：**又称扫帚星，有尾巴的天外飞石，一般来自。

**流星体（meteoroid）：**小行星（asteroid）或者彗星（comet）的碎片。

**流星（meteor）**：流星体划过天际（进入大气层）时的样子（陪你去看流星雨落在这地球上...）。

**陨石（meteorite）**：嘭，流星体掉到地上砸个*坑（crater）*，现在改名叫陨石。

流星体、流星、陨石，都是宇宙中的碎屑，只是在不同状态下有不同的名称。

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210817155301.jpg)

补充小知识：asteroid一般不会撞地球，曾经撞过一次，可爱的恐龙宝宝因此都挂了。comet和meteor很多，各种流星雨，一般都没啥危害，*嗯，除非像《你的名字》里那种。*

### 太阳系的起源

行星都是同时形成的，都是来自于同一种物质，那就是**星云（nebula）：**灰和气体组成的云（想象一下雾霾吧）。

**超新星（supernova）**：恒星（star）年纪大了后就要爆炸，恒星：我老啦！我要炸啦！

超新星爆炸出来的冲击波会引起星云**坍塌（collapse**）**收缩（contract）聚合（coalesce**），把这些灰搞成了一个个球体行星（planets）和太阳（the sun）可以想象一下用面粉搓汤圆，当然还有一些边角料（asteroids和meteoroids）。

## Sun

The Sun is the **Solar System’s star** and by far its most massive component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses), which comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System, produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain **nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium**, making it a main sequence star. This releases an enormous amout of energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light.

The Sun is a **population I star**; it has a *higher abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium than the older population II stars*. Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars, so the first generation of stars had to die before the Universe could be enriched with these atoms. The oldest stars contain few metals, whereas born later have more. This high **metallicity** is thought to have been crucial to the Sun’s development of a planetary system because the planets form from the *accretion* of “metals”.

*Key words*: Corona, Sunspot and Solar wind.

## Inner Solar System

The **inner Solar System** is the region comprising *the terrestrial planets* and *the asteroid belt*. Composed mainly of *silicates and metals*, the objects of the inner Solar System are *relatively close to the Sun*; the *radius* of this entire region is less than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210817101847.jpg)

The four terrestrial or inner planets have *dense, rocky compositions*, *few or no moons*, and *no ring systems*. They are composed largely of **refractory minerals**, such as the silicates—which form their *crusts and mantles*—and metals, such as iron and nickel, which form their *cores*. Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth and Mars) have **atmospheres** substantial enough to generate weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface features, such as rift valleys and volcanoes.

*Key words*: terrestrial planets, atmosphere, impact craters and tectonic suface features.

### Terrestrial planets 类地行星

**类地行星**是以*硅酸盐石作为主要成分的行星*。它们跟*类木行星*有很大的分别，因为那些气体行星*主要是由氢、氦和水等组成*，而不一定有固体的表面。

类地行星的结构大致相同：一个主要是铁的金属中心，外层则被硅酸盐地幔所包围。表面一般都有峡谷、陨石坑、山和火山。

A terrestrial planet is a planet that is composed primarily of *silicate rocks or metals*. Within the Solar System, *the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the Sun*, i.e. Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Terrestrial planets have a solid planetary surface, making them substantially different from the larger giant planets, which are composed mostly of some combination of hydrogen, helium, and water existing in various physical states.

#### Mercury

**Mercury** (0.4 AU from the Sun) is *the closest planet to the Sun* and on average, all seven other planets. The *smallest planet in the Solar System*, Mercury has no natural satellites. Besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of *contraction* early in its history. Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the *solar wind*. Its *relatively large iron core and thin mantle* have not yet been adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact, or that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.

*Key words*: no natural satellites, geological features.

#### Venus

Venus (0.7 AU from the Sun) is *close in size to Earth* and, like Earth, has a *thick silicate mantle around an iron core*, a *substantial atomsphere*, and evidence of internal geological activity. It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense. Venus has no natural satellites. It is the *hottest planet*, with surface temperatures over 400℃, most likely due to the amount of **greenhouse gases** in the atmosphere. No definitive evidence of current geological activity has been detected on Venus, but it has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere, which suggests that its atmosphere is being *replenished* by volcanic eruptions.

*Key words*: close in size to Earth; substantial atomsphere; geological activity; no magnetic field; greenhouse gases.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210817161857.jpg)

Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "*sister planet*" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. However, it is radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the *densest atmosphere* of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The *atmospheric pressure* at the planet's surface is about 92 times the sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Venus has, by far, the *hottest surface* of any planet in the Solar System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F), even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus is shrouded by an *opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid*, preventing its surface from being seen from space in visible light. It may have had water oceans in the past, but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway greenhouse effect. The water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a planetary magnetic field. Venus' surface is a dry desertscape interspersed with slab-like rocks and is periodically resurfaced by volcanism.

*Key words*: sister planet; carbon dioxide; densest atmosphere; opaque layer; water oceans; solar wind; volcanism.

*TPO 24 Lecture 4: Venus 金星*

- In other areas, you’ve got canyons, rift valleys, meteoric craters, uh, lava domes- these lava formations that look like giant pancakes- and also volcanoes… 
- 在其他地区，有火山、轮廓清晰的山谷、陨石坑、熔岩穹丘，这些熔岩的形状就像是巨大的薄饼。
- Well, one of the most interesting features on the surface are, in fact, the shield volcanoes. 
- 火山也是如此，金星地表最有意思的特征是火山的地盾。
- Shield volcanoes form when magma comes out of the ground in the same spot over and over again. 
- 地盾是由于岩浆反复从一个地方喷出地表而形成的。
- On Venus, however, volcanoes are not clustered in discrete zones like they’re on Earth. Instead, they’re more or less randomly scattered over Venus’ surface. 
- 而在金星上，火山并不像在地球上一样在个别地区集中。相反地，它们很随机的分布在金星的表面。很是壮观，金星上大部分是盾状火山，它们的分布十分分散。

#### Earth

**Earth** (*1 AU from the Sun*) is the largest and densest of the inner planets, the only one known to have current *geological activity*, and the only place where life is known to exist. Its *liquid hydrosphere* is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where *plate tectonics* has been observed. Earth's i is radically different from those of the other planets, having been *altered by the presence of life* to contain 21% free oxygen. It has *one natural satellite, the Moon,* the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.

*Key words*: geological activity; life; liquid hydrosphere; plate tectonics; atmosphere; one natural satellite.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210817161902.jpg)

#### Mars

**Mars** (1.5 AU from the Sun) is smaller than Earth and Venus. It has an *atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide* with a surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (roughly 0.6% of that of Earth). Its surface, *peppered with vast volcanoes*, such as Olympus Mons, and rift valleys, such as Valles Marineris, shows *geological activity* that may have persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago. Its red colour comes from iron oxide (rust) in its soil. Mars has *two tiny natural satellites* (Deimos and Phobos) thought to be either *captured asteroids*, or *ejected debris* from a massive impact early in Mars's history.

*Key words*: atmosphere; carbon dioxide; vast volcanoes; rift valleys; geological activity; two tiny natural satellites.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210817161946.jpg)

*TPO 30 Lecture 3: Mars 火星*

- For example, one major discovery was that at one point water was present on Mars. How do we know? Well, in 2004, an exploration robot discovered jarosite there. 
- 比如，一个重大发现是火星上有水。我们是怎么知道的？2004年，一个探索型机器人在火星上发现了黄钾铁矾。
- Jarosite is a yellowish-brown mineral with a crystalline structure that's also found on Earth. It contains iron, potassium, and hydroxide.
- 黄钾铁矾是一种黄棕色的矿物质，其晶体结构在地球上也有。其中有铁、钾和氢氧化物。
- The interesting thing is that on Earth at least, it needs highly acidic water to form. So we've got water... or had it at one point. 
- 有趣的是，在地球上，需要酸性很强的水才能形成这种结构。所以我们有水，或一度曾有水。

### Asteroid Belt 小行星带

**小行星带**是太阳系内介于火星和木星轨道之间的*小行星密集区域*，由已经被编号的120,437颗小行星统计得到，98.5%的小行星都在此处被发现。这么多小行星能够被凝聚在小行星带中，除了太阳的引力作用以外，木星的引力起着更大的作用。

The asteroid belt is the *circumstellar disc* in the Solar System located roughly *between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter*. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids. About half the mass of the belt is contained in the *four largest asteroids*: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210816113651.jpg)

Asteroids except for the largest, Ceres, are classified as small Solar System bodies and are composed mainly of *refractory rocky and metallic minerals, with some ice*. They range from a few metres to hundreds of kilometres in size. *Asteroids smaller than one meter* are usually called **meteoroids** and micrometeoroids (grain-sized), depending on different, somewhat arbitrary definitions.

The asteroid belt occupies the *orbit between Mars and Jupiter*, between 2.3 and 3.3 AU from the Sun. It is thought to be *remnants* from the Solar System's formation that failed to *coalesce* because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter. The asteroid belt contains tens of thousands, possibly millions, of objects over one kilometre in diameter. Despite this, the total mass of the asteroid belt is unlikely to be more than a thousandth of that of Earth. The asteroid belt is very sparsely populated; spacecraft routinely pass through without incident.

*Key words*: composition; meteorids and micrometeoroids; gravitational interference of Jupiter; remnants.

*TPO 2 Lecture 4:*

- So people went to work on finding objects that would be at that missing distance from the Sun, and then in 1801, the object Ceres was discovered. 
- 所以人们从那个空档到太阳间寻找缺失的天体，后来到1801 年，谷神星被发现。
- And Ceres was in the right place - the missing spot. Uh, but it was way too faint to be a planet. 
- 谷神星正好在那个空档里。嗯，但作为一颗行星它又太微弱。
- Um, and so, Ceres was the first and is the largest of what became many objects discovered at that same distance. 
- 嗯，那么，谷神星是第一个也是在同一距离发现的天体里面最大的天体。

#### Meteorite 陨石／陨星

**陨石**是地球以外脱离原有运行轨道的宇宙流星或尘碎块飞快散落到地球或其它行星表面的未燃尽的石质、铁质或是石铁混合的物质。*大多数陨石来自于火星和木星间的小行星带*，小部分来自月球和火星。陨石大体可分为石质陨石、铁质陨石，石铁混合陨石。

A meteorite is a solid piece of debris from an object, such as a *comet, asteroid, or meteoroid*, that originates in outer space and survives its passage through the atmosphere to reach the surface of a planet or moon. *When the object enters the atmosphere*, various factors such as friction, pressure, and chemical interactions with the atmospheric gases cause it to *heat up and radiate energy*. It then becomes a meteor and forms a fireball.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210816114123.jpg)

Meteoroid 流星体

Meteor 流星

Meteorite 陨石／陨星

TPO 13 Lecture 4:

- Ok, I wanna go over the different types of meteorites, and what we have learned from them about the formation of Earth and solar system. 
- 好的，我要讲一下各种不同的陨星，以及我们从这些陨星上获取的关于地球构造和太阳系的信息。
- Uh... the thing is, what's especially interesting about meteorites is that they come from interplanetary space. 
- 陨星特别有趣的一点是，这些陨星来自行星际空间
- But they consist of the same chemical elements that are in matter originated on Earth, just in different proportions. 
- 但是他们包含着同样的起源于地球的化学元素，只是成分所占比例不同而已。
- **Meteoroids** are…for the most part anyway…they are just smaller bits of asteroids and comets. 
- 流星体在大多数情况下，它们是一小部分的小行星和彗星。
- When these bits enter Earth’s atmosphere, well, that makes them so special that they get a special name. They are called “**meteors**.”
- 当这些碎片进入地球大气层之后，这就使它们变的特别，以至于会有一个特别的名字，称为流星。
- Most of them are very small, and they burn up soon after entering the Earth's atmosphere. 
- 大部分流星都体积很小，在进入大气层之后会很快燃烧起来。
- *The larger ones that make it through the atmosphere, and hit the ground* are called **meteorites**. So meteorites are the ones that actually make it through.
- 那些体积较大，进入大气层之后直击地面的流星便叫做陨石。因此陨石其实就是那些穿透大气层到达地球表面的行星体。

## Outer Solar System

The outer region of the Solar System is home to the **giant planets** and **their large moons**. The centaurs and many **short-period comets** also orbit in this region. Due to their greater distance from the Sun, the solid objects in the outer Solar System contain a higher proportion of *volatiles*, such as *water, ammonia, and methane* than those of the inner Solar System because the *lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid*.

*Key words*: giant planets; short-period comets; higher porportion of volatiles; lower temperatures.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210817155356.jpg)

The four outer planets, or **giant planets** (sometimes called *Jovian planets*), collectively make up 99% of the mass known to orbit the Sun. 

- *Jupiter and Saturn* are together more than 400 times the mass of Earth and consist overwhelmingly of the **gases hydrogen and helium**, hence their designation as *gas giants*. 
- *Uranus and Neptune* are far less massive—less than 20 Earth masses each—and are composed *primarily of ices*. For these reasons, some astronomers suggest they belong in their own category, **ice giants**. 

All four giant planets have **rings**, although only Saturn's ring system is easily observed from Earth. The term **superior planet** designates planets outside Earth's orbit and thus includes both the outer planets and Mars.

*Key words*: giant planets; gases hydrogen and helium; gas giants; ice giants; rings; superior planet.

### Jupiter

**Jupiter** is *2.5 times the mass of all the other planets put together*. It is composed largely of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's strong internal heat creates semi-permanent features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the Great Red Spot. Jupiter has *79 known satellites*. The four largest, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, show similarities to the terrestrial planets, such as volcanism and internal heating. Ganymede, the largest satellite in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury.

*Key words*: hydrogen and helium; terrestrial planets; volcanism and internal heating; Great Red Spot.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210817162000.jpg)

### Saturn

Saturn, distinguished by its *extensive ring system*, has several similarities to Jupiter, such as its *atmospheric composition* and *magnetosphere*. Although Saturn has 60% of Jupiter's volume, it is less than a third as massive. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is *less dense than water*. The rings of Saturn are made up of small ice and rock particles. Saturn has 82 confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of these, *Titan and Enceladus*, show signs of geological activity. *Titan*, the second-largest moon in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury and the only satellite in the Solar System with a substantial atmosphere.

*Key words*: extensive ring system; less dense than water; Titan and Enceladus; geological activity.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210817162007.jpg)

### Uranus

Uranus, is the *lightest of the outer planets*. Uniquely among the planets, it orbits the Sun on its side; its axial tilt is over ninety degrees to the ecliptic. It has a much colder core than the other giant planets and radiates very little heat into space. Uranus has *27 known satellites*, the largest ones being Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda.

*Key words*: lightest of the outer planets

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210817162018.jpg)

### Neptune

Neptune, though slightly smaller than Uranus, is more massive and hence more dense. It radiates more internal heat, but not as much as Jupiter or Saturn. Neptune has 14 known satellites. The largest, *Triton*, is *geologically active*, with geysers of liquid nitrogen. Triton is the only large satellite with a *retrograde orbit*. Neptune is accompanied in its orbit by several minor planets, termed Neptune trojans, that are in 1:1 resonance with it.

*Key words*: geologically active; retrograde orbit.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210817162024.jpg)

### Comet 彗星

**彗星（Comet）**是进入太阳系内*亮度和形状会随日距变化而变化的绕日运动的天体*，呈云雾状的独特外貌。

彗星分为*彗核、彗发、彗尾*三部分：彗核由冰物质构成，当彗星接近恒星时，彗星物质升华，在冰核周围形成朦胧的彗发和一条稀薄物质流构成的彗尾。

彗星的*质量、密度很小*，

- 当远离太阳时只是一个由水、氨、甲烷等冻结的冰块和夹杂许多固体尘埃粒子的雪球。
- 当接近太阳时，彗星在太阳辐射作用下分解成彗头和彗尾，状如扫帚。

A comet is an icy, small Solar System body that, when *passing close to the Sun*, warms and begins to release gases, a process called *outgassing*. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210816113705.jpg)

*TPO 26 Lecture 3*:

- These are the comets that circle around the Sun pretty regularly.
- 有一些彗星非常有规律地环绕太阳运行。
- They return again and again, predictably, after a certain period of time. That’s why we say their orbits are periodic. 
- 根据预测，在一定时间之后，它们一次又一次的回来。这是为什么我们说他们的轨道是周期性的。
- Probably the most famous and brightest of these is *Halley’s comet*.
- 它们之中最有名最明亮的也许是哈雷彗星。
- Halley’s comet comes from far out in the solar system, goes in close to the Sun, and then out again.
- 哈雷彗星来自于太阳系较远的地方，运行到离太阳较近的地方，然后又再一次离开。
