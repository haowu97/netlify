## Solar Wind Composition

The **solar wind** is a *stream of charged particles* realeased from the upper atmosphere of the Sun, called the *corona*. 

- This *plasma* mostly consists of *electrons, protons and alpha particles*.
- The composition of the solar wind plasma also includes a mixture of materials found in the solar plasma: trace amounts of *heavy ions and atomic nuclei* C, N, O, Ne and Mg…
- There are also rarer traces of some other *nulcei and isotopes* such as P, Ti, Cr and Ni…

Its particles can *escape the Sun’s gravity* because of their *high energy* resulting from the *high temperature of the corona*, which in turn is a result of the *coronal magnetic field*.

## Fast and slow solar wind

The solar wind varies in *density, temperature and speed* over time and over solar latitude and longitude. The sloar wind is observed to exist in two fundamental states, termed *the slow solar wind and the fast solar wind*, through their difference extend well beyond their speeds.

- In near-Earth space, the **slow solar wind is** observed to have a velocity of 300-500 km/s, a temperature of ~ 100 MK and a composition that is a *close match to the corona*. 
- By contrast, the **fast solar wind** has a typical velocity of 750 km/s, a temperature of 800 MK and it nearly *matches the compostion of the Sun’s photosphere*. 

The slow solar wind is *twice as dense and more variable in nautre* than the fast solar wind.

## Observation from Earth

The only time the solar wind is observable on the Earth is when it is strong enough to produce pehenomena such as the *aurora and geomagnetic storms*.

### Aurora: 极光

An **aurora**, sometimes referred to as *polar lights, northern lights, or southern lights*, is a natural light display in the Earth’s sky, *predomintaly seen in high-latitude regions*(around the *Arctic and Antarctic*).

Auroras are the result of *disturbances in the magnetosphere* caused by solar wind.

### Geomagnetic storms: 地磁风暴

A **geomagnetic storm** (commonly referred to as *solar storm*) is a *temporary disturbance of the Earth’s magnetosphere* caused by a solar wind shock wave and/or cloud of magnetic field that interacts with the Earth’s magnetic field.

The disturbance that drives the magnetic storm may be a *solar coronal mass ejection* (CME) or a *co-rotating interaction region* (CIR), a high-speed stream of solar wind originating from a coronal hole. The frequency of geomagnetic storms increases and decreases with the *sunspot cycle*.

The **solar cycle** or solar magnetic activity cycle is a nearly periodic *11-year change* in the Sun's activity measured in terms of *variations in the number of observed sunspots* on the solar surface. Levels of solar radiation and ejection of solar material (solar wind), the number and size of sunspots, *solar flares*, and coronal loops all exhibit a *synchronized fluctuation*, from active to quiet to active again, with a period of 11 years.

During solar maximum, geomagnetic storms occur more often, with the majority driven by CMEs. During solar minimum, storms are mainly driven by CIRs (though CIR storms are more frequent at solar maximum than at minimum).

Geomagnetic storm **effects**

1. Disruption of electrical systems
2. Disruption of Communications
3. Navigation systems
4. Satellite hardware damage and loosing orbit

## Observation from Space

The solar wind is what **blows the tails of comets** back away from the bodies of comets as they go through the solar system.
