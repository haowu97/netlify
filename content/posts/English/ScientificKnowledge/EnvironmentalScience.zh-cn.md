**环境科学**是一门研究人类社会发展活动与环境演化规律之间相互作用关系，寻求人类社会与环境协同演化、持续发展途径与方法的科学。大多数环境问题涉及人类活动。

Environmental science is an *interdisciplinary academic* field that integrates physical, biological and information sciences to the study of the environment, and the solution of environmental problems. Environmental science emerged from the fields of natural history and medicine during *the Enlightenment*. Today it provides an integrated, quantitative, and interdisciplinary approach to the study of environmental systems.

### Global Environmental Change

**全球环境变化**是由人类活动和自然过程*相互交织（interaction）*的系统驱动所造成的一系列陆地、海洋与大气的生物物理变化。可分为自然因素和人为影响，主要课题为*全球变暖（global warming）*和环境污染，全球环境变化可能会给人类带来巨大威胁。

Environmental change is a change or disturbance of the environment most often caused by human influences and natural ecological processes. Environmental changes can include any number of things, including natural disasters, human interferences, or animal interaction. Environmental change does not only encompass physical changes, but it can be things like an *infestation* of invasive species is also environmental changes.

*TPO 23 Lecture 2*: 自然因素

- Basically, a cloud either contributes to the cooling of Earth's surface or to its heating. 
- 基本上，云的作用是降低或升高地球表面的温度。
- Earth's climate system is constantly trying to strike a balance between the cooling and warming effects of clouds. 
- 地球天气系统不断地试图在云的降温和变暖效应中寻求一个平衡。
- It's very close, but overall, the cumulative effect of clouds is to cool Earth rather than heat it.
-  这十分相近，但是总体上来说，云的累积作用是降低地球的温度而不是加热。
- And this balance between the amount of solar radiation- energy from the Sun- that's absorbed by Earth and the amount that's reflected back into space, we call this Earth's  "radiation budget." 
- 这个平衡是指太阳的辐射量，也就是被地球吸收太阳能量与反射回宇宙中的能量之间的平衡，我们称之为地球辐射收支。

*TPO 11 Lecture 3*: 人为影响

- When land gets developed for human use, the landscape changes.We don't see as many types of vegetation, trees, grasses *and so forth*. 
- 当土地被开发为人类使用，景观就会改变。我们不再能看到那么多的植被，树木，草地等等。
- This in turn leads to other losses:the loss of animal that once lived there.Err... but these are the obvious changes, but there are also less obvious changes, like the climate. 
- 这接着就导致了其他损失:那些曾经在那里居住的动物。但这些都是显著的变化。还有一些变化并不那么显眼，比如气候变化。
- The changes in the temperature pattern had been brought about by the loss of *wetlands*. 
- 湿地减少产生了气温变化。（农民引流湿地中的水以变成适合耕种的土地，湿地减少使气温降低。）

## Natural Resources 资源

**自然资源**是指自然界中人类可以直接获得用于生产和生活的物质。可分为两类，

1. *不可再生资源（non renewable resources）*，如各种金属、化石燃料等，需要经过漫长的地质年代才能形成;
2. *可再生资源（renewable resources）*，指生物、水、土地资源等，能在较短时间内再生产出来或循环再现; 和风力、*太阳能（solar energy）*等，被利用后不会导致贮存量减少的能源。

Natural resources are resources that exist without actions of humankind. This includes all valued characteristics such as magnetic, gravitational, electrical properties and forces etc. On Earth it includes sunlight, atmosphere, water, land (includes all minerals) along with all vegetation, crops and animal life that naturally *subsists* upon or within the *heretofore* identified characteristics and substances。

*TPO 12 Lecture 4*: solar energy

- Alright folks, let's continue our discussion of alternative energy sources, and move on to what's probably the most well-known alternative energy source, umm, solar energy. 
- 好了，我们继续讨论可再生能源。这次来讲讲众所周知的再生能源——太阳能。
- The sun basically provides earth with a virtually unlimited source of energy every day, but the problem has always been how do we tap this source of energy. 
- 太阳基本每天都为地球提供了无限的能量来源，问题就是我们如何有效地利用它。
- Solar energy is everywhere, but it's also quite diffused.And the thing is, the dream of solar energy is not a new one. Humanity has been trying to use the sun's light as a reliable source of energy for centuries. 
- 太阳能到处都是，但同时它很分散。而且利用太阳能的梦想并不是新鲜事。人类试图利用太阳能作为可信赖的能源已经好几个世纪了。

*TPO 33 Lecture 2*: water

- I'd like to continue with the topic of managing water resources, but I want to focus on a particular case, a—uh, an example of water management that's made us reconsider the methods we use when we make these decisions. 
- 我想继续水资源管理的话题，但我想重点讲一个具体的例子，一个水资源管理的例子，让我们重新思考我们在做决策时采取的方式。
- So let's look at what's happening in the Colorado River basin. The Colorado River basin is a region in the southwest United States. 
- 所以让我们看看在科罗拉多河流域发生的事。科罗拉多河流域是美国西南部的一个地方。
- Seven states rely on the Colorado's water, and as you can imagine, as the populations of these states began to grow, it became clear that a system to distribute, ah, to make sure each state got its fair share of water, some kind of system had to be created.
- 有七个州依赖着科罗拉多的水资源。正如你所想， 随着这些州的人口开始增长，很明显为了确保每个州的水资源得到公平分配，就需要建造某种分配系统。

## Waste Disposal/Management 垃圾处理

*垃圾（waste/ refuse）*是人类日常生活和生产中产生的废弃物，由于排出量大，成分复杂多样，需要无害化（e.g. *anaerobic decomposition厌氧分解*）、资源化（*recycle, garbage classification*）和减量化（*compression压缩，burning*）处理。广泛采用的城市生活垃圾处理方式主要有卫生填埋、高温堆肥（有机分解）和焚烧等。

Waste disposal/management are the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal. This includes the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste, together with monitoring and regulation of the waste management process. Waste can be solid, liquid, or *gaseous* and each type has different methods of disposal and management.

*TPO 34 Lecture 2*:

- At the end of yesterday's class, we were discussing *landfills* and the hundreds of millions of tons of everyday garbage which are deposited into them each year in the United States. 
- 在昨天那节课的最后，我们讲了垃圾填埋区和美国每年存放的上百吨日常生活垃圾。
- It's a growing problem-quite simply we're running out of space to put our garbage. 
- 这个问题越来越突出了。简单来说，我们用以堆放垃圾的空间快用光了。
- And this is especially true for solid organic waste... food scraps from home or food-processing plants, waste from farms, that sort of thing. 
- 这对有机固体废物而言尤其如此：来自家庭或食品加工厂的食物残渣，来自农场的废弃物，诸如此类。
- Did you know that two-thirds of the waste sitting in our landfills is organic material?
- 你们知道吗？在垃圾填埋区里三分之二的垃圾是有机材料。
