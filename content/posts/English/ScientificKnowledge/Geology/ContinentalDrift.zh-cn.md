## Overview

**Continental drift** is the hypothesis that the Earth's **continents** have *moved over geologic time* relative to each other, thus appearing to have "drifted" across the ocean bed. The speculation that continents might have 'drifted' was first put forward by **Abraham Ortelius** in 1596. The concept was independently and more fully developed by **Alfred Wegener** in 1912, but his hypothesis was rejected by many for lack of any motive mechanism. **Arthur Holmes** later proposed **mantle convection** for that mechanism. The idea of continental drift has since been **subsumed** by the theory of **plate tectonics**, which explains that the continents move by riding on plates of the Earth's **lithosphere**.

The **continental drift** hypothesis was developed in the early part of the 20th century, mostly by Alfred Wegener. Wegener said that continents move around on Earth’s surface and that they were once **joined together** as a single supercontinent. While Wegener was alive, scientists did not believe that the continents could move. Alfred Wegener proposed that the continents were once united into **a single supercontinent** named **Pangaea**. He suggested that Pangaea broke up long ago and that the continents then moved to their current positions. He called his hypothesis **continental drift.**

## Key Principles

The **outer layers of the Earth** are divided into the **lithosphere** and **asthenosphere**. The division is based on differences in **mechanical properties** and in the method for the transfer of heat. The lithosphere is **cooler and more rigid**, while the asthenosphere is **hotter and flows more easily**. This division should not be confused with the **chemical subdivision** of these same layers into the **mantle** (*comprising both the asthenosphere and the mantle portion of the lithosphere*) and the **crust**: a given piece of mantle may be part of the lithosphere or the asthenosphere at different times depending on its temperature and pressure.

The **key principle** of plate tectonics is that the lithosphere exists as separate and distinct **tectonic plates**, which ride on the **fluid-like** asthenosphere. Plate motions range up to a typical 10–40 mm/year (Mid-Atlantic Ridge; about as fast as fingernails grow), to about 160 mm/year (Nazca Plate; about as fast as hair grows). The **driving mechanism** behind this movement is described below.

The location where two plates meet is called a **plate boundary**. Plate boundaries are commonly associated with **geological events** such as **earthquakes** and the **creation of topographic features** such as **mountains, volcanoes, mid-ocean ridges**, and **oceanic trenches**.

## Evidence

Four main evidences

- Ancient fossils
- Same rock types
- Grooves and rock deposits
- Coal found in cold region

### Ancient fossils

**Ancient fossils** of the *same species of extinct plants and animals are found in rocks of the same age but are on continents that are now widely separated*. Wegener proposed that the organisms had lived **side by side**, but that the lands had moved apart after they were dead and fossilized. He suggested that *the organisms would not have been able to travel across the oceans*. For example, the fossils of the seed fern **Glossopteris** were too heavy to be carried so far by wind. The reptile **Mesosaurus** was a swimming reptile but could only swim in fresh water. **Cynognathus and Lystrosaurus** were land reptiles and were unable to swim.

### Same rock types

Besides the way the **continents fit together**, Wegener and his supporters collected a great deal of evidence for the continental drift hypothesis. For one, **identical rocks** of the same type and age are found on both sides of the **Atlantic Ocean**. Wegener said the rocks had formed side-by-side and that the land had since moved apart. *Mountain ranges with the same rock types, structures, and ages are now on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean.* The **Appalachians** of the eastern United States and Canada, for example, are just like mountain **(Caledonides)** ranges in eastern Greenland, Ireland, Great Britain, and Norway. Wegener concluded that they formed as a single mountain range that was separated as the continents drifted.

### Grooves and rock deposits

**Grooves and rock deposits** left by **ancien glaciers** are found today on different continents very close to the **equator**. This would indicate that the glaciers either formed in the middle of the ocean and/or covered most of the Earth. Today glaciers only form on land of higher elevation and nearer the poles. *Wegener thought that the glaciers were centered over the southern land mass close to the South Pole and the continents moved to their present positions later on*.

### Coal found in cold region

**Coral reefs** and **coal-forming swamps** are found in **tropical and subtropical** environments, but ancient **coal seams** and **coral reefs** are found in locations *where it is much too cold today*, such as the Arctic Pole and the North Coastline of Russia. Wegener suggested that *these creatures were alive in warm climate zones and that the fossils and coal later had drifted to new locations* on the continents.
