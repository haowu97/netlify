While weathering and erosion are similar processes, they are not synonymous. **Weathering** involves the *breakdown of rocks and minerals* on Earth, whereas **erosion** involves the *removal of soil and rock materials*.

*Table*: Mian Differences between Weathering and Erosion

| Weathering                             | Erosion                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| happens at site of rock or mineral     | happens away from original location   |
| does not involve movement of materials | involves movement of materials        |
| breaks down rocks and minerals         | moves and deposits recks and minerals |

## 1. Weathering

**Weathering** is the *breaking down* of *rocks, soils, and minerals as well as wood and artificial materials* through *contact with water, atmospheric gases, and biological organisms*. Weathering occurs *in situ* (on site, with little or no movement), and should not be confused with *erosion*, which involves the transport of rocks and minerals by agents such as water, ice, snow, wind, waves and gravity.

While **physical weathering** is most rapid in very cold or very dry environments, **chemical reactions** are most rapid where the climate is wet and hot. However, *both types of weathering occur together, and each tends to accelerate the other*. For example, frost weathering creates cracks in the surface of a rocky outcrop, making it more *susceptible* to chemical reactions by providing paths for water and air to *penetrate* the rock.

There are two basic types of weathering, mechanical weathering and chemical weathering.

### 1.1 Mechanical weathering/ physical weathering

Mechanical weathering (physical weathering) makes rocks crumble.

**Physical weathering** involves the breakdown of rocks and soils through the mechanical effects of heat, water, ice, or other **agents**.

Example:

#### 1.1.1 Ice/Frost Wedging

Many rock surfaces have small cracks on them. Water can freeze in these cracks when it is cold, and then melt when the weather is warmer. This repeated freezing and thawing creates ice wedges, which can cause rocks to break.

#### 1.1.2 Roots of plants

**Roots of plants** growing into cracks may put pressure on the surrounding rock, eventually breaking rocks apart as the roots grow.

### 1.2 Chemical weathering

Chemical weathering changes rock or soil molecular structure.

**Chemical weathering** involves the *chemical reaction* of water, atmospheric gases, and biologically produced chemicals with rocks and soils.

Example:

#### 1.1.1 Acidification

You’ve probably heard of acid rain. **Acid rain** is *water with sulfuric and nitric acids* from the *burning of coal and fossil fuels*, along with *volcano eruptions*. The acids create a reaction when they hit stone, causing the *surface to wear* and the *composition to soften*. Acidification can also be caused by organisms like *lichens*, which are created from *algae and fungi*.

#### 1.1.2 Oxidation

Within the weathering environment, **chemical oxidation** of a variety of metals occurs. The most commonly observed is the *oxidation of Fe2+ (iron) by oxygen and water to form Fe3+ oxides and hydroxides* such as goethite, limonite, and hematite. This gives the affected rocks a *reddish-brown coloration* on the surface which crumbles easily and weakens the rock. Many other metallic ores and minerals oxidize and hydrate to produce colored deposits, as does sulfur during the weathering of *sulfide minerals* such as chalcopyrites or *CuFeS2 oxidizing to copper hydroxide and iron oxides*.

## 2. Erosion

In earth science, **erosion** is the action of surface processes (such as water flow or wind) that *removes soil, rock, or dissolved material from one location on the Earth's crust, and then transports it to another location*. Erosion is distinct from weathering which involves no movement.

Removal of rock or soil as clastic sediment is referred to as *physical or mechanical erosion*; this contrasts with *chemical erosion*, where soil or rock material is removed from an area by *dissolution*.

If you look at examples of erosion, you’ll see that there aren’t necessarily types of erosion, but different methods of erosion.

### 2.1 Splash Erosion

This type of erosion is caused by *rainfall*. It is the first stage in the process of **water erosion**. When raindrops hit the soil, they cause individual soil particles on the ground to *disperse and splash* back down. This makes it difficult for rain to permeate the ground, so the water builds up on the surface and leads to the formation of *moving water*, in the form of *runoff*.

### 2.2 Mass movement

**Mass movement** is the *downward and outward movement of rock and sediments* on a *sloped surface*, mainly due to the force of *gravity*.

Mass movement is an important part of the erosional process and is often the first stage in the breakdown and transport of weathered materials in mountainous areas. It moves material *from higher elevations to lower elevations* where other eroding agents such as *streams and glaciers* can then pick up the material and move it to even lower elevations. Mass-movement processes are always *occurring continuously on all slopes*; some mass-movement processes act very slowly; others occur very suddenly, often with disastrous results.

**Slumping** happens on *steep hillsides*, occurring along distinct *fracture zones*, often within materials like *clay* that, once released, may *move quite rapidly downhill*. In some cases, the slump is caused by *water beneath* the slope weakening it.

**Surface creep** is the *slow movement of soil and rock debris by gravity* which is usually not perceptible except through extended observation.
