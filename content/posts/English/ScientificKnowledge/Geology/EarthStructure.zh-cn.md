**地球的结构（Earth's Core)**，主要要搞懂地球的内部大致结构有几个，都有什么特征，组成成分是什么，固态还是液态，起了一些什么作用，对于我们会有什么影响。

## Overview

The **internal structure of Earth,** structure of the **solid Earth**, or simply structure of Earth refers to **concentric spherical layers** subdividing the Solid earth, i.e., excluding **Earth's atmosphere** and **hydrosphere**. It consists of an **outer silicate solid crust**, a highly **viscous asthenosphere** and **solid mantle**, **a liquid outer core** whose flow generates the **Earth's magnetic field**, and **a solid inner core**.

Scientific understanding of the internal structure of Earth is based on observations of **topography** and bathymetry, observations of rock in outcrop, samples brought to the surface from greater depths by **volcanoes or volcanic activity**, analysis of the **seismic waves** that pass through Earth, measurements of the **gravitational and magnetic fields** of Earth, and experiments with **crystalline** solids at pressures and **temperatures** characteristic of Earth's deep interior.

### Two ways to define the structure of Earth

The structure of Earth can be defined in **two ways**: by **mechanical properties** such as rheology, or **chemically**.

1. Mechanically, it can be divided into **lithosphere, asthenosphere, mesospheric mantle, outer core, and the inner core**.
2. Chemically, Earth can be divided into the **crust, upper mantle, lower mantle, outer core, and inner core.**

### How to inferred that earth has different layers？

The **layering of Earth** has been **inferred indirectly** using the time of travel of **refracted** and **reflected** seismic waves created by **earthquakes**. The core does not allow shear waves to pass through it, while the speed of travel (**seismic velocity**) is different in other layers. The changes in seismic velocity between different layers causes **refraction** owing to Snell's law, like light bending as it passes through a prism. Likewise, **reflections** are caused by a large increase in seismic velocity and are similar to light reflecting from a mirror.

## Crust

**Earth's crust** is **a thin shell** on the outside of Earth, accounting for less than 1% of Earth's volume. The **thin parts** are the **oceanic crust**, which underlie the ocean basins (5–10 km) and are composed of dense iron magnesium silicate igneous rocks, like **basalt**. The **thicker crust** is **continental crust**, which is less dense and composed of sodium potassium aluminium silicate rocks, like **granite**. Earth’s crust is the **top component** of the **lithosphere**, a division of Earth's layers that includes the crust and the upper part of the mantle. The lithosphere is broken into **tectonic plates** whose motion allows heat to escape from the interior of the Earth into space.

The crust lies on top of the mantle, a configuration that is stable because the upper mantle is made of peridotite and so is significantly **more dense** than the crust. The **boundary between** the crust and mantle is conventionally placed at the **Mohorovičić discontinuity**, a boundary defined by a **contrast in seismic velocity**.

The temperature of the crust increases with depth, reaching values typically in the range from about 100 °C (212 °F) to 600 °C (1,112 °F) at the boundary with the underlying mantle. The temperature increases by as much as 30 °C (54 °F) for every kilometer locally in the upper part of the crust.

## Mantle

Earth's mantle extends to a depth of 2,890 km, making it the planet's **thickest layer**. The **pressure** at the bottom of the mantle is ≈140 GPa (1.4 Matm). The mantle is composed of **silicate rocks** richer in iron and magnesium than the overlying crust. Although **solid**, the mantle's extremely hot silicate material can **flow** over very **long timescales**. **Convection** of the mantle propels *the motion of the tectonic plates in the crust*. The source of heat that drives this motion is the **primordial heat** left over from the planet's formation renewed by the **radioactive decay** of uranium, thorium, and potassium in Earth's crust and mantle.

## Core

The **average density of Earth** is 5.515 g/cm3. Because the **average density of surface** material is only around 3.0 g/cm3, we must conclude that **denser materials** exist within Earth's core. **Seismic measurements** show that the core is divided into two parts, a "solid" **inner core** with a radius of ≈1,220 km and **a liquid outer core** extending beyond it to a radius of ≈3,400 km. The densities are between 9,900 and 12,200 kg/m3 in the outer core and 12,600–13,000 kg/m3 in the inner core.

### Inner core

**Earth's inner core** is the innermost geologic layer of the planet Earth. It is primarily a solid ball with a radius of about 1,220 km (760 mi), which is about 20% of Earth's radius or 70% of the Moon's radius.

There are no samples of Earth's core accessible for **direct measurement**, as there are for Earth's mantle. Information about Earth's core mostly comes from analysis of **seismic waves** and **Earth's magnetic field**. The inner core is believed to be composed of an **iron–nickel alloy** with some other elements. The temperature at the inner core's surface is estimated to be approximately 5,700 K (5,430 °C; 9,800 °F), which is about the temperature at the surface of the Sun.

### Outer core

**Earth's outer core** is **a fluid layer** about 2,400 km (1,500 mi) thick and composed of mostly **iron and nickel** that lies above Earth's solid inner core and below its mantle. Its outer boundary lies 2,890 km (1,800 mi) beneath Earth's surface. The transition between the inner core and outer core is located approximately 5,150 km (3,200 mi) beneath the Earth's surface. Unlike the inner (or solid) core, the outer core is **liquid**. The **magnetic field** is generated by **electric currents** due to the motion of convection currents of a mixture of **molten iron and nickel** in the Earth's outer core: these **convection currents** are caused by heat escaping from the core, a natural process called a geodynamo.
