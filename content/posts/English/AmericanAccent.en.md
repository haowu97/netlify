*Accent* is a combination of three main components: *intonation*( speech music), *liaisons*(word connections), and *pronunciation*(the spoken sounds of vowels, consonants and combinations).

America is a big country, and while the **pronunciation varies** from the East Coast to the West Coast, from the southern to the northern states, two components that are uniquely American stay basically **the same-the speech music, or intonation, and the word connections or liaisons**.



the vowels that say their own name simply have a line over them: [ā], [ē], [ī], [ō], [ū].
