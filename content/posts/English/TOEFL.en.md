## A Look Inside the TOEFL Test

![](https://moocs.unipus.cn/files/course/2019/10-15/104044ca0e33859752.png)

The TOEFL Test allows you to demonstrate that you have the English language skills necessary for effective communication in academic setting. Here's an overview of what to expect on the test.

The TOEFL Test has four sections: **Reading, Listening, Speaking, and Writing**. All four sections are completed in one testing session, with three hours of testing time.

The first section is **Reading**.

- The Reading section has three or four passages of about 700 words each.
- For each passage, you will answer 10 multiple choice questions.
- You will have 54 to 72 minutes to complete the Reading section. During that time, you can return to previous questions to review or change your answers.

Next is the **Listening** section.

- For this section, you will wear a headset to hear the conversations and lectures.
- There are 2 or 3 conversations. Each is about 3 minutes long and has 5 multiple choice questions.
- There are 3 or 4 lectures. Each of those about 3 to 5 minutes long and has 6 multiple choice questions.
- In the Listening section, you will only hear the conversations and lectures one time. Also, you must answer the questions in the order that they are presented. In this section, you can't go back to previous questions.
- You will have 41 to 57 minutes to complete the section.

You probably noticed that **in the Reading and Listening sections, the testing time and number of questions can vary.** That is because every test includes some extra questions that are being evaluated by ETS for use in future tests and do not count toward your score.

So, your test will either have extra Reading questions or extra Listening questions, but never both. And you won't know which questions are the extra ones, so make sure you do your best on all of them.

After the Listening section, there is a required **10-minute break**. So use the time to have some water or a snack and refresh yourself for the rest of the test.

After the break is the **Speaking** section.

- The Speaking section has four tasks and takes about 17 minutes to complete.
- For each task, you will be asked a question and will be given a short time to prepare your response. Then, you will speak into the microphone on your headset for 45 to 60 seconds, depending on the question.
- Some tasks require you to listen to part of a conversation or lecture, so you will continue to use your headset. Some also require you to read a short passage.

Last is the **Writing** section.

- You will complete two writing tasks in 50 minutes by typing your responses into the computer.
- In the first task, you will read a passage and listen to a short lecture, then write your response. You will have 20 minutes to write your response.
- In the second task, you will be asked your opinion on an issue and you will have 30 minutes to write your response.

And that's it. After you finish the test, you should go do something fun. You've earned it. You did your best on an important test and that's a great accomplishment.

### How the TOEFL Test Is Scored

Each of the four sections of the test—Reading, Listening, Speaking and Writing—is scored on a scale from 0~30. The total score is the sum of the four section scores, with a range of 0~120.

You will learn more details about how each section is scored in weeks 2~5 of the course.

## Reading

Reading tips
Practice questions



**The first section is the Reading section.**

This section uses reading passages from **university-level textbooks that introduce a topic**. 

**There are 3 or 4 reading passages of about 700 words each**. For each passage, there are **10 multiple-choice questions**. You will be able to see the reading passage as you answer each question.

Most questions have four choices and a single correct answer. Some questions ask you to select two or more correct answers from a larger group of choices.

You will have **54 to 72 minutes** to complete the Reading section. During that time, you can return to previous questions to review or change your answers.

#### Skim the passage

Take a glance at the first few sentences of the first paragraph.

Take a look at the first sentence of each of the other paragraphs.

Create an outline, for example,

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/Figs/20210510180340.png)

#### Take notes for more detail

**Just jot down phrases for time saving.**

Remember that as you look at each question, **you' l be able to see the paragraph or paragraphs that the question refers to** on one side of your computer screen.

You will also be able to scroll through the entire passage.

You can return to previous questions to review and change your answers.

### Question types

You will learn more details about the Reading section this week through a series of videos about the different Reading question types.

- **Factual Information and Negative Factual Information questions** ask about facts, details, definitions or other information presented/ Explicitly stated by the author.
- **Inference questions** ask about ideas and arguments that are not explicitly stated in the text. **Rhetorical Purpose questions** are similar. They ask about *why* the author presents a piece of information.
- **Vocabulary questions** measure whether you know the meaning of important words in a reading passage.
- **Reference questions** look similar to Vocabulary questions. A word or phrase is highlighted in the passage, and you are asked what that word refers to.
- **Sentence Simplification questions** ask you to choose a sentence with the same meaning as a given sentence.
- For **Insert Text questions**, you are given a new sentence and asked where in the passage it would best fit. These questions require you to understand the logic of the passage and the grammatical connections between sentences.
- **Prose Summary questions** ask you to select the major ideas from a passage by distinguishing them from minor points or ideas that are not in the passage. **Fill in a Table questions** ask you to correctly categorize facts presented in the passage.

#### Factual Information and Negative Factual Information questions

*Factual Information questions* ask you to recognize information explicitly stated in the text. This information can include:

- Major ideas
- Supporting details
- Definitions

In a *Negative Factual question,* 3 out of 4 answers are correct and only one answer choice is incorrect.

*Factual Information* questions like:

1. According to the paragraph, ...
2. Paragraph X answers which of the following?

*Negative factual Information* questions like:

1. According to the paragraph which of the following is **NOT** true?
2. The author mentions all of the following **EXCEPT**

Tips:

1. Don't select an answer just because it contains words or phrases from the paragraph. Evaluate each option to determine if it is correct
2. For negative factual information questions, answer is either not in the paragraph, or it contradicts information in the paragraph

#### Inference and Rhetorical Purpose Question

An *Inference question* could ask you to identify information that is not explicitly stated. Like,

1. Which of the following can be **inferred** from paragraph 1 about X?
2. The author of the paragraph **implies** that X
3. Paragraph X **suggests** which of the following about Y?

*Rhetorical Purpose questions* ask why an author has presented a piece of information. Rhetorical Purpose Key words:

1. to illustrate
2. to explain
3. to contrast
4. to refute
5. to note
6. to support

*Tips for Rhetorical Purpose questions*:

1. **Eliminate wrong answers** if you cant identify the correct answer immediately.
2. While **some statements may be true**, but it is not the reason why the author has presented the information.

#### Vocabulary questions

*Vocabulary questions* ask you to identify the meanings of words or phrases as they are used in a reading passage.

**Word or phrase highlighted in the reading passage**. Question like,

1. The word X in the passage **is closest in meaning to**
2. The phrase X in the passage **is closest in meaning to**
3. In stating X, the author **means hat**

Words that students at university level should know. So the strategy is to **build vocabulary**.

1. *Academic Vocabulary* (EXPECTED TO KNOW): Academic vocabulary words can be used across many fields of study.
2. *Specialized Vocabulary* (DEFINED FOR YOU): Specialized vocabulary words are specific to one field. Don't need to know before.

**Only academic vocabulary words will be tested in the Reading section**.

Tips:

1. Latin and Greek roots of English words

#### Reference questions

*Reference questions* look similar to Vocabulary questions. A word or phrase is highlighted in the passage, and you are asked what that word refers to.

- Usually the word is a *pronoun*, like "she," "they" or "it".
- It could also be a *relative pronoun*, like "which," "that" or "whom".

#### Sentence Simplification questions

*Sentence Simplification questions* ask you to identify a sentence that has essentially the same meaning as a sentence from a reading passage.

- Which of the sentences below best **expresses the essential information** in the following sentence? Incorrect choices change the meaning in Important ways or leave out essential information.

For Sentence Simplification questions, the *correct answer* choice:

- May leave out minor or unimportant details/ **Non-essential information**
- Restates the most important information/ **Essential information** in a simpler way

We need to understand the relationship between pieces of information in the sentence. Some important information like, 

- Cause/effect
- Conclusion based on evidence

*Less important information*

- Examples
- Text in parentheses
- Specific numbers or dates

#### Insert Text Questions

For *Insert Text questions*, you are given a new sentence and asked where in the passage it would best fit. 

These questions require you to understand the logical order of ideas in a reading passage and the grammatical connections between sentences.

**Every reading passage has one Insert Text Question.**

Tips: The text needed to be inserted usually include some pronouns. Really know your *pronouns* and match them to the words they refer to in a text.

- this/these
- that/those
- they/them
- him/her
- he/she/it
- which

#### Prose Summary & Fill in a table questions

The *Prose Summary questions* are designed to show that you recognize the major ideas and relative importance of information
in a reading passage.

When answering Prose Summary questions, you will need to **select the three answer choices** that express the most important ideas in the passage.

In the real test, you will **drag and drop your answers into the box**.

There are 6 answer choices, 

- 3 correct choices express the most important ideas,
- 3 incorrect choices **misrepresent information or discuss minor points**

Prose Summary questions are worth **2 points** toward raw score.

- get 2 points if you choose all 3 correct answers
- get 1 point if you choose 2 correct answers
- get zero points for 1 or no correct answers

For Prose Summary and Fill in a Table questions, your **answers do not have to be in a particular order**.

You can change your answer during the allotted time for the reading section.

In *fill in a table questions*, you will need to drag and drop you answers into two(or three) categories.

**Each reading passage will have one Prose summary question, or one Fill In A Table Question, but not both**.

Tips: take notes and create an outline when reading.

### Additional reading materials

## Listening



The second section of the *TOEFL iBT®* test is the Listening section.

This section contains two types of listening materials: *conversations and lectures*. Both are based on the actual speech that is used at universities in which English is the language of instruction. Along with accents from North America, you may hear accents from the U.K. and Australia.

The Listening section of the test contains multiple-choice tasks for which test takers must select the correct answer. This section contains **either 2 conversations and 3 lectures or 3 conversations and 4 lectures**. You will hear them only one time each.

The *conversations* are typical of those that occur on university campuses in which English is the primary language spoken. For example, there may be a conversation between a student and a professor about course requirements or the content of a lecture. There may also be a conversation between a student and a university staff member about nonacademic matters, such as registering for a class or paying for housing.

**Each conversation is about 3 minutes long and has 5 multiple-choice questions**. You will *not* be able to see the questions while you listen to the conversations. 

The *lectures* represent the kind of language used when professors teach in a classroom. The content of the lectures reflects the content that is presented in **introductory-level university courses**.

Lectures cover a broad range of subjects and topics. Here are a few examples:

- **Arts**: architecture, music history, literature, ceramics, art history
- **Life Science**: botany, animal behavior, nutrition, aquatic organisms
- **Physical Science**: weather, astronomy, pollution, technology, geology
- **Social Science**: anthropology, business, child development, history

You will not be expected to have prior knowledge of the subject matter. The information you need to answer the questions will be contained in the lecture.

**Each lecture is about 5 minutes long and has 6 multiple-choice questions**. Just as with the conversations, you will *not* be able to see the questions while you listen to the lectures.

You will have 41 to 57 minutes to complete the Listening section. During that time, you *cannot* return to previous questions to review or change your answers. The questions must be answered in the order they are presented.

You will learn more details about the Listening section this week through a series of videos. The first video explains how to approach a listening passage. It will be followed by several other videos about the different *Listening question types*.

- **Gist-content and Gist-purpose questions** require you to understand the general topic or main idea of a conversation or lecture, or its main purpose.
- **Detail questions** require you to understand and remember significant details or facts from a conversation or lecture.
- **Function questions** ask about a speaker's intended meaning, or what a speaker hopes to accomplish.
- **Attitude questions** measure whether you understand the position a speaker is taking or a speaker's opinion about something.
- In **Organization questions**, you may be asked about the overall organization of a conversation or lecture, or about the relationship between two parts of a conversation or lecture.
- **Connecting Content questions** measure your understanding of the relationships among ideas in a conversation or lecture.
- **Inference questions** ask you to draw conclusions or predict outcomes based on the information presented in a conversation or lecture.



### Approaching Listening Passages

*Get oriented*: The image on the screen and the narrator‘s words will help you figure out what the situation

- Conversations always start with a statement that **tells who the speakers are**
- For a lecture, you will first see an image indicating the **basic subject area** of the lecture
    - In some of the lectures, *words* may be presented on the screen as if written on a chalkboard. These words will be the kinds of terms or proper names that a professor might write down for the class while giving a lecture
    - Sometimes a content visual will appear as it would if the class were looking at an *illustration* in a textbook or on a screen.

**Identify important elements**

1. First, the **main idea or purpose** of the conversation;
2. Second, **key points** that the speakers make;
3. Third the **attitudes or opinions** that the speakers express

**Interactive Lectures**

In some of the lectures, the professor is the only speaker. In others, students make comments or ask questions. In the case of these interactive lectures, you may be asked about what a student said or about a student's attitude or opinion. You may also be asked about the professor's attitude or opinion. So, it's important to listen for all of the attitudes and opinions expressed as well as for the facts and ideas presented. 

**Do Key Points Support the Main Idea?**

Sometimes the key support for the main idea is quite obvious. The professor may make a statement that is the main idea of the lecture. Then she may list two or three reasons why that statement is true, elaborating on each one. Each reason could be a supporting point that is tested in a listening lecture. 

But be careful: Not all of the key points will be *directly related* to the main point or purpose. They may be a well-developed sub-topic or an aside. 

Also, remember that often, when a *TOEFL®* speaker wants you to pay close attention to what she is going to say, she will give you a *signal*, just as she might do in a regular classroom or in any campus setting. She might say something like "**Think about this**." Speakers can also give a signal by speaking a little louder or a little slower, for emphasis. You should also assume that a detail is important if the speaker uses it as an example of something, in which case she might say **"for example" or "for instance."**

**Taking Notes**

As you practice for the *TOEFL iBT®* Listening section on your own, start out by listening twice to each practice lecture and taking notes. Your notes should be brief; don't try to write down *everything* you hear. The first time through, take notes on the main idea and key supporting points for that idea. The second time you listen, try to fill in more of the supporting details in your notes, paying attention to how the ideas connect with one another. Remember that in the real TOEFL iBT test you will hear the lecture only once, so you will also need to practice taking notes on lectures while listening just once. See if taking notes helps you answer the questions or not. Some test takers find that taking notes is helpful, but others find that they miss too much of the lecture while trying to take notes. Determine which approach works best for you.

**Managing Your Time**

Many test takers want to know how much time they should take to answer the questions in the Listening section of the *TOEFL®* test. **A good pace is about 30 seconds per question** (two questions per minute). You can use [free practice materials](https://www.ets.org/toefl/ibt/prepare) to time yourself and get close to that pace.

**Listening to Academic Materials**

The more listening you do in English, the easier it will be for you to follow conversations and lectures in English, including those on the TOEFL iBT test. So, listen to academic material in English as much as you can—radio and TV broadcasts, podcasts, documentaries, and audio books. If you want to improve the ease with which you can process material you hear in English, increase the amount of time you spend listening to academic material in English. 

**Listen to academic lectures in English as much as possible**.

Be sure to listen to lectures in **various subject** areas: science, social science, business, arts, literature.

Start with **short lectures** on topics you are familiar with, then build up to **longer ones** on topics that are not familiar to you.

**Keep listening, even if you miss something.**

### Gist-content and Gist-purpose questions

The gist of something is the main point or key idea.

**Gist-content and Gist-purpose questions** require you to understand the general topic or main idea of a conversation or lecture, or its main purpose.

1. Gist-content questions: identify main ideas/ topic in a conversation or lecture.
2. Gist-purpose questions:  identify the main purpose of a conversation or lecture, namely, why is this lecture/ conversation happening?

Recognizing the question type:

- Mainly about
- Mainly discussing
- Why does the student...?
- What is the main purpose...?

There will always be **either a Gist-content question or a Gist-purpose question**, but never both.

Always the **first question** after listening to the passage.

If there are *two main ideas*, you'll be asked to choose 2 of the 4 answer options, instead of just one.

### Detail Questions

*Detail questions* require you to understand and remember significant details or facts from a conversation or lecture.

Recognizing the question type:

1. According to...
2. What is...?

Only **important details** would be questioned. 

You will not be expected to memorize trivial details

- such as whether something happened in 1977 or 1978

The answer to a Detail question will always be **explicitly stated** in a conversation or lecture.

### Function questions 

*Function questions* ask you to identify **the particular meaning** of a statement in a given context. A Function question may ask you to determine what a speaker was trying to accomplish by saying a particular thing.

The *real meaning* is usually different form the *surface or literal meaning*.

Function questions can include phrases like: 

1. "What does the professor mean when he says … ?"
2. "Why does the student say … ?"

### Attitude questions

*Attitude questions* ask you to show understanding of the speaker's attitude or their feelings about something.

Attitude questions can include phrases like: 

1. What is the professor's attitude?
2. What does the student think about?
3. What can be **inferred**...?

To identify the speaker's attitude, listen for phrases like

1. "What I think..."
2. "It seems to me..."

The Attitude question will then refer to 

1. how valid the speakers' argument is? or
2. how sure of the facts the speaker Is.

A speaker’s *tone of voice* cannot help you answer an Attitude question. Is the speakers voice:

- Calm or emotional?
- Relaxed or nervous?
- Certain or confused?
- Enthusiastic or bored?

### Organization Questions

*Organization questions* ask you to show understanding of how a lecture is structured. Organization questions can include phrases like:

1. Why does the professor mention...?
2. Why does the professor discuss...?

Often about the *examples* in a lecture.

*Tips*: Listen for Signal Words like,

- Introduction
- Major ideas
- examples
- conclusion

These might be like,

- Sequence words: First, next, then, second, finally
- Time or chronology: After, at last, before, during, now, since
- Obviously, of course
- Cause and effect: Accordingly, as a result, because, for example, for instance
- In conclusion, to summarize

### Connecting Content Questions

*Connecting Content questions* measure your understanding of the relationships among ideas in a conversation or lecture. They may ask you,

1. Fill in a table or chart
2. What is the likely outcome...? 
    1. Make a prediction based on what was stated in a conversation or lecture.

This type of question will ask you to put **together information from different sentences or different parts of the conversation or lecture**.

You may be asked to identify things like

- Steps in a process
- Cause/ effect relationship
- Classification
- Make a prediction

### Inference Questions

*Inference questions* ask listeners to show an understanding of the **meaning of something not directly stated**. They use phrase like

1. What are the implications of...?
2. What does the professor **imply**...?
3. What can be **inferred**...?

### Additional Listening Materials

Practice: Take the [Free Practice Test](https://www.ets.org/toefl/ibt/prepare/free_practice_test) and when listening to a conversation or lectures, try to **predict what kinds of questions will be asked, as well as what the answers to those questions will be**. Are any of the TOEFL questions the same or similar to your questions? What about the answers? The more you practice predicting what questions will be asked, the better you will get at predicting and the better you will get at listening for important information. This will help you improve your confidence about taking the Listening section of the test, as you realize you know what to expect, and what to listen for!

If you're looking to practice more, you can use these resources to practice listening to the kinds of materials that are similar to *TOEFL®* Listening passages. The links will take you outside of the course and the UMOOCs platform.
