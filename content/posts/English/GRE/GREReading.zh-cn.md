## GRE阅读概述

### 题量

一个Verbal Section的阅读题为10道：

- 任意一个Verbal Section里面，阅读文章都有4篇，分别涉及自然科学（natural sciences）、生命科学（biological sciences）、社会科学（social sciences）、人文学科（humanities）这四大学科，每个学科门类通常各占1篇。这4篇文章合计配有8-9道阅读题。
- 还有1-2道逻辑单题，往往涉及非学术的生活和社会话题。

|             | Section（含长文） | Section（纯短文） |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 长450±20字  | 1篇，4题          | 0篇，0题          |
| 短160±20字  | 1篇，2-3题        | 1篇，3-4题        |
| 短120±20字  | 2篇，1-2题        | 3篇，1-2题        |
| 逻辑40-80字 | 1篇，1题          | 1-2篇，1题        |
| 总计        | 4+1篇，10题       | 4+（2-1）篇，10题 |

GRE阅读文章都取材于学 术期刊和著作，学术英文往往讨论一些抽象的话题或与此相关的作品、研究和活动。

- GRE文章与正常的学术英文也有差别。正常学术论文也许有8000 字，篇幅足够，论证充分，论据较多，有些甚至用图表和图片展示来辅助论证，一目了然。但是，这样的学术文章经测试专家压缩、改编后， 变为大约450字、160字或120字的GRE文章。这意味着，GRE文章的**信息高度浓缩**，证据省略较多，论点和观点的数目也减少了。
- **严密的逻辑推理结构**
- 逻辑严密、结构复杂、句子繁难

### Skill

"All the questions can be answered on the basis of the information provided in the passage, and you are not expected to rely on any outside knowledge.”——OG

无须背景，头脑空白，定位解题，文字一一对应

文章看得一定尽量快，要把主要的时间放在做题本身，因为最终是正确解题决定了分数。

**先读文章后看题干，看了题干以后，通常先不看选项，而是以题干所问内容，回原文定位，找到相应的句子，大概知道答案以后，再到选项中找预想答案的中心词。**

有它的同义词或等价词的选项可先保留，通常2-3个，作为候选。没有这些预想答案中心词的选项可直接排除，**通常不必读完这些选项（choices）的所有词汇。这一点对于选项特别长的题目尤其有效**。

只要将结构分析训练好、题型分类熟悉好，速度和正确率就会逐渐上去。

## 结构化阅读法

### 原理

区别于平时的自然阅读法，从学术类文章固定的结构逻辑出发

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/2021/StructuredReading.jpg)

**GRE文章是学术文章的浓缩**：学术论文无非是多层论点的组合 。写学术论文，就是想清楚说什么主题（Introduction, Topic），有几个大的方面（Section:Literature Review, Method, Result, Analysis），每个方面又分几个部分或几大论点（Part=several paragraphs：别人的观点及评价、自己的观点），这些部分通常不会明确说出，但可以识别几大块内容；每个大部分又分几个小论点或段落来说明（Paragraph=kw，别人观点的内容、评价、自己假说的内容的第一点、第二点、结果等），每个小论点都要有3-4个或更多论据（a b c; x y z; u v w）来支撑。

论文是*主题-节-部分-段落-句子*的四层总分结构或层级系统。

一个事物，可以多层分解，每层的分解方式相似，每层的规律也都
相似，这就类似于分形几何学讲的**分形结构（fractals）**。

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/2021/GREPAper.jpg)

### 文章层次结构分析

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/2021/GREPassageStructure.jpg)

除了新老观点的主题在转折句或新观点（But/However/Yet句），其他文章的主题都在首段前三句（现象解释，主题=Phen./Prob.，论点说明，主题=首句TW/TS）。

短文张 v.s. 长文章：

- 对于短文章：考试的重点是**句子之间的逻辑关系、论据对论点的支持或反对的关系**。
- 在读长文章时，重点不在段落中间的证据，而是在**首末句、转折句和过渡句**。**中间证据皆可略读或快速处理，不求甚解，待做题时**，看到题干内容后，通过各段首句的结构信息定位相应段落及中间句子，找到定位句后再考虑答案。

#### 现象解释/ 问题解决型

【Eample】Since the Hawaiian Islands have never been connected to other land masses, the great variety of plants in Hawaii must be a result of the long-distance dispersal of seeds.

There is some dispute about the method of transport involved. Some biologists argue that ocean and air currents are responsible for the transport of plant seeds to Hawaii. Yet the results of flotation experiments and the low temperatures of air currents cast doubt on these hypotheses. More probable is bird transport.

The author of the passage is primarily concerned with

A discussing different approaches biologists have taken to testing theories about the distribution of plants in Hawaii

B discussing different theories about the transport of plant seeds to Hawaii

解析：**主题题**，选B

#### 新老观点型

新老观点型文章中，**反驳意见和新观点就是主题（TS=AW-+KWn）**。

【Eample】*Traditionally*, **pollination** by wind *has been* viewed as a reproductive process marked by random events in which the vagaries of the wind are compensated for by the **generation of vast quantities of pollen(kw1)**.

However, a number of features that are **characteristic** of wind-pollinated plants **reduce pollen waste(kw2)**.

The author of the passage is primarily concerned with discussing

(B) the kinds of airflow patterns that permit wind-pollinated plants to capture pollen most efficiently

(D) a recently proposed explanation of a way in which wind-pollinated plants reduce pollen waste

(E) a specific morphological attribute that permits one species of wind-pollinated plant to capture pollen

解析：**新老观点文章中转折句才是文章的主题**，选D。

#### 论点说明型

【Eample】The **evolution of intelligence** among early large mammals of the grasslands **was due** in great measure **to** the **interaction** between two ecologically synchronized groups of these animals, the hunting carnivores and the herbivores that they hunted.

解析：因果关系中，原因（interaction）是重点。

The kind of intelligence favored by the interplay of increasingly smarter catchers and increasingly keener escapers is defined by **attention**—that aspect of mind carrying consciousness forward from one moment to the next.

解析：**首局/转折句的主干中的新词就是kw**

The elements of intelligence and consciousness come together marvelously to produce different **styles** in predator and prey.

The author is primarily concerned with

(A) disproving the view that herbivores are less intelligent than carnivores

(B) describing a relationship between animals’ intelligence and their ecological roles

解析：**论点说明型文章的主题句定位到第一段首句**即可，选B。

### 段落层次结构分析

段落是论点与论据的组合，对于所有论点及其论据的内容，**抓住论点都是最重要的，其后的论据通常都可略读**。在略读时，可以尝试**找出中间证据与首句论点的对应词汇**。

- 逻辑等价词（logical equivalents）
- 同义词（synonyms）

通过这种前后照应，我们可以从已知单词推出未知生词；而且，即便中间有内容读不懂，只要明白它一定只能从属于首句，就不用担心其中可能出现偏离内容。

少数情况中也有：先事实后解释、先数据后假说的**分总关系**，i.j.kw.a.b 。

*有些段落不只一个论点*，而是有2个论点或1个论点1个态度（有论证支持的态度都可算作论点），这点在新GRE的短文中尤其常见。对这样的段落，段落分析本身就涉及论点之间的关系。

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed@master/2021/GREParagraphStructure.jpg)

#### 并列

**并列记位置**：通常，GRE一个论点的并列内容不会超过2-3句，这时可适当把握并列内容，在证据中找并列词，是为“并列找并列 ”。但少数时候，并列内容可能多达4个，这时记住位置，比记住内容重要，是为“**位置 > 内容**”。

- 举例：，for example, for instance, in the case of, say, illustrated by
- 分类

#### 对比

文科讲比对，是最常见的结构。比较的对象通常在两句的主语，而比较的内容则通常在两句的宾语，有时也在谓语。

解题技巧：**对比找反义，反义找宾语**。

【Example】The elements of intelligence and consciousness come together marvelously to produce **different styles** in predator and prey. Herbivores and carnivores develop **different kinds of attention** related to escaping or chasing. Although in both kinds of animal, arousal stimulates the production of adrenaline and norepinephrine by the adrenal glands, the effect in herbivores is primarily *fear*, **whereas** in carnivores the effect is primarily *aggression*. For both, arousal attunes the animal to what is ahead. Perhaps it does not experience forethought as we know it, but the animal does experience something like it. The predator is *searchingly aggressive*, inner-directed, tuned by the nervous system and the adrenal hormones, but aware in a sense closer to human consciousness than, **say**, a hungry lizard’s instinctive snap at a passing beetle. Using past events as a framework, the large mammal predator is working out a relationship between movement and food, sensitive to possibilities in cold trails and distant sounds — and yesterday’s unforgotten lessons. The herbivore prey is of a **different** mind. Its mood of *wariness rather than searching* and its attitude of general expectancy instead of anticipating are silk-thin veils of tranquility over an explosive endocrine system.

| Core                                 | Function                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| different styles                     | kw2: h≠c. kw2’(段落的第二句)  |
| (A.N. fear vs aggression)            | h1=c1, h1≠c1                  |
| (=arousal. c: searching vs. h: wary) | h2=C2, C2.1.C2.2 ≠ h2.1. h2.2 |

#### 因果 / 相关 / 机制

**理科讲因果，数量因果必考**

**正/负相关主要考两者的数量关系**

- A⬆→B⬇
- A⬆→B⬆

**机制**：*略读中间，抓住首尾*

- 如果考到中间细节，*通过题干提供的核心词定位到相应的论点内容，再到证据或细节句里找到内容*，在选项中找文字对应就可以了。

**因果找双方，机制找首尾**

【Example】Why during sickness should body temperature of warm-blooded animal rise? It has **long been known** that the level of serum iron in animals falls during infection. Garibaldi first suggested a relationship between fever and iron. He found that microbial synthesis of siderophores -- substances that bind iron -- in bacteria of the genus Salmonella declined at environmental temperatures above 37°C and stopped at 40.3°C. Thus, fever would make it more difficult for an infecting bacterium to acquire iron and thus to multiply. Cold-blooded animals were used to test this hypothesis. Kluger reported that of iguanas infected with the potentially lethal bacterium A. hydrophilia, more survived at temperatures of 42°C than at 37°C, even though healthy animals prefer the lower temperature. When animals at 42°C were injected with an iron solution, however, mortality rates increased significantly.

解析：

- 现象解释段落；
- long been known用以前的观点作为背景；
- 温度上升→铁减少→细菌难以繁殖→宿主得以存活
- 证据支持

| Core                   | Function    |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| sick: t ⬆?             | Phen / TW   |
| G: t⬆-iron↓            | a: KW1 X CS |
| K: test:               | kw2'        |
| t⬆ iron⬇: animals⬆     | m           |
| vs. t⬆ iron⬆: animals⬇ | vs. n       |

9.According to the passage, Garibaldi determined which of the following?

(A) That serum iron is produced through microbial synthesis

(B) That microbial synthesis of siderophores in warm-blooded animals is more efficient at higher temperatures.

(C) That only iron bound to other substances can be used by bacteria.

(D) That there is a relationship between the synthesis of siderophores in bacteria of the genus Salmonella and environmental temperature.

(E) That bacteria of the genus Salmonella require iron as a nutrient.

解析：考察温度与铁合成的相关性，D

10.If it were to be determined that similar phenomena occur in warm-blooded animals, which of the following, assuming each is possible, is likely to be the **most effective treatment** for warmblooded animals with bacterial infections?

(A) Administering a medication that lowers the animals' body temperature

(B) Injecting the animals with an iron solution

(C) Administering a medication that makes serum iron unavailable to bacteria

(D) Providing the animals with reduced-iron diets

(E) Keeping the animals in an environment with temperatures higher than 37°C

解析：考察铁含量与存活率的相关性，C

【Example】Because of its accuracy in outlining the Earth's subsurface, the seismic-reflection method remains the most important tool in the search for petroleum reserves. In field practice, a subsurface is **mapped by** arranging a series of wave-train sources, such as small dynamite explosions, in a grid pattern. As each source **is activated**, it **generates** a wave train that moves downward at a speed **determined uniquely by** the rock's elastic characteristics. As rock interfaces are **crossed**, the elastic characteristics encountered generally **change** abruptly, which **causes** part of the energy to be **reflected back** to the surface, where it is recorded by seismic instruments. The seismic records must be **processed** to correct for positional differences between the source and the receiver, for unrelated wave trains, and for multiple reflections from the rock interfaces. Then the data **acquired** at each of the specific source locations are combined to **generate** a physical profile of the subsurface, which can eventually be used to **select** targets for drilling.

解析：类似于机制解释类文章，阅读策略，**记住首尾**（该方法是一种有效确认石油资源的方法）即可，**中间非常多的动词步骤压根不需要记住**。

| Core                                      | Function        |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| s-method+                                 | kw / ts         |
| (**source**→Wave→ec→...→data→**profile**) | (a→b→c→d→e)机制 |

For the following question, **consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply**.（多选题）

4.According to the passage, in the seismic-reflection method which of the following have a significant effect on the signal detected by the seismic instruments

A presence of unrelated wave trains

B placement of the seismic instruments

C properties of rocks through which the wave train has traveled

解析：考察原文中出现的并列，The seismic records must be **processed** to correct for positional differences between the source and the receiver, for unrelated wave trains, and for multiple reflections from the rock interfaces. ABC均正确！

注：**连续并列/列举题经常会被考到，但是并列出现的时候略读记住位置即可（位置>内容），题目中出现再进行精确定位**。

5.It can be inferred from the passage that the seismic-reflection method would be likely to yield an inaccurate physical profile of the subsurface in which of the following circumstances?

(A) If the speed at which the wave train moved downward changed

(B) If the receiver were not positioned directly at the wave-train source

(C) If the rock on one side of a rock interface had similar elastic characteristics to those of the rock on the other side

(D) If the seismic records obtained for the different sources in a grid were highly similar to each other

(E) If there were no petroleum deposits beneath the area defined by the grid of wave-train sources

解析：**连续动作取非，考察方法中可能出现的步骤错误，任何步骤出问题都可能造成不精确，因此只能从选项出发进行定位**；A选项原文中都有，B选项可以被矫正，因此不影响，DE属于无关选项，选C（原文中要求弹性特征改变）。

6.Which of the following best describes the **organization of the passage**?

(A) A method is criticized, and an alternative is suggested.

(B) An illustration is examined, and some errors are exposed.

(C) An assertion is made, and a procedure is outlined.

(D) A series of examples is presented, and a conclusion is drawn.

(E) A hypothesis is advanced, and supporting evidence is supplied.

解析：结构/ 各句之间关系题，C

#### 让步转折

作为一种辅助论证方法：让步常常与原来的论点相反，之后常常转折回原来的观点，佐证原观点的正确性。

**让步找相反，转折找相同**。

【Example】**Although** these observations are **true**, Pessen **overestimates** their importance by concluding from them ~~that the undoubted progress toward inequality in the late eighteenth century continued in the Jacksonian period and that the United States was a class-ridden, plutocratic society even before industrialization.~~

**含有态度的让步转折必考**。

【Example】Scholars often **fail to see** that music played an important role in the preservation of African culture in the United States. They **correctly note** that slavery stripped some cultural elements from Black people -- their political and economic systems -- **but** they underestimate the significance of music in sustaining other African cultural values.

Correctly note与fail to see相反，这里相当于发生了让步；but发生转折。

### 句子层次结构分析

#### 长句处理处理原则

**主干>修饰**：

- *主干>修饰*：句⼦子抓主干 SVO => np1 V np1
- 例外：**名词抽象 抓住修饰**
  - *长名词短语一般找第一个名词，第一个抽象则继续找第二个*
- 并列成分（主语并列，谓语并列，宾语并列），只抓一个即可，各个并列成分等价

**主句>从句**：

- *主句>从句*：SVO > CP (clause phrase)
  - that / which / v-ing / v-ed / , np that…(同位语)
  - 从句修饰遵循*就近原则*，一般修饰最近的词
- *主句>从句*：
  - svo because / when / if svo.
  - 重点通常不在独立从句（补充说明），重点在主句主干
- 例外：**主语从句/宾语从句，要单独分析从句主干**。
- 从句/修饰的嵌套仍然抓主句即可

*让步，对⽐从句，找反义词*(反义找宾语)

- Although / while svo, svo.
- svo, whereas / but svo.
- 语义压倒法：因果双方/对比内容，比各个分句的语法主干更重要

【Example】But the recent discovery of detailed **similarities** in the skeletal structure of the flippers in all three groups **undermines** the attempt to explain away superficial resemblance as **due to convergent evolution** —the independent development of similarities between unrelated groups in response to similar environmental pressures. 

解析：主语长名词短语一般找第一个名词，由于第一个名词(discovery)抽象，因此找第二个(similarities)；宾语长名词短语一般找第一个名词，由于第一个名词(attempt)抽象，找到不定式中的原因due to convergent evolution。

【Example】**None** of these **translations** to screen and stage, however, **dramatize** the **anarchy** at the conclusion of A Connecticut Yankee, *which* ends with the violent overthrow of Morgan's three-year-old progressive order and his return to the nineteenth century, *where* he apparently commits suicide *after being labeled* as lunatic for his incoherent babblings about drawbridges and battlements. 

【Example】Modern philosophers now *trace that notion back* at least to **Descartes and Spinoza**, **but** it was not *explicitly articulated* until the late eighteenth century, **by Kant**, ~~and did not become built into the structure of academic institutions and the standard self-descriptions of philosophy professors until the late nineteenth century~~.

解析：对比找直接找两个对比句的宾语，并列结构可以略读。

#### 常考句子：中间证据

出现以下结构时，中间句也很可能会作为考题的考点：

- 句⼦蕴含对比 → 提炼一对反义词
  
  - 比较与对比like, similar; unlike, rather than, more than, different fromcontrast, whereas
  - 数字比较(most)、时间比较(first)
  - 让步转折
    - although, though, while; despite, in spite of+NP[主句转折]
    - did/does, may/might, may seem, there is some evidence [But]
    - of course, certainly, undoubtedly, no doubt, no problem [But]
    - It is true that, to be sure, Granted; this is not to deny [But]
    - 无上述提示词而突然出现的相反态度或内容为让步 [But」
  - *否定肯定not.. but/instead/rather...

- 中间大写
  
  - 段中人名 Hargrave and Geen: H.G;
  - 物种名 cladocerans:c 便于定位

### 总结：阅读提炼的重点

**文章**：结构性句子：首末句；however yet but转折句；态度句（2-3题/10题）

**段落**：对比找反义；因果找双方，机制找末句；并列找并列（2-3题/10题）

**中间句**：让步、对比比较、大写词与专业名词、特殊长句（占3-5/10）

纯细节题：考句内的细节内容，占1-3/10。

## 3. 题型与解法

GRE阅读的速度是150-160words/min；做题的时间平均为1minute=1'，

- 有的题目相对容易，可30seconds=30''完成，
- 有的题目，比如无法定位某个句子的信息题，则可能花上1.5minutes=1.5'

这是考试的速度要求，达到这个要求，就可以在**17分钟（17'）左右完成所有文章的阅读和做题**。为了取得理想的分数，**正确率达到7/10=70%**是相对合适的。

1'做题的时间分配基本如下：

1. 1'=60''
2. 3-5''：读题干
3. 5-10''：定位原文
4. 40''：选项比较-原文对应

关键：定位

按照从题干出发定位原文的情况，可以把GRE题目分为3大类，每一类又包含一些小类：

- 核心题：针对主题、结构、态度发问。细分为主题题、结构题、态度题。
- 信息题：针对全文或全段内容发问，无法从题干定位某个句子，选项分散对应原文。仅信息题一种。
- 定点题：针对某个特定句子发问，可分为细节题、列举题、取非题、作用题等。
- 考推理的逻辑题相对独立，常常针对一篇短小的文章出题；另外一种考推理的类比题，针对文中某个句子出题，做题时不必牵涉文章的理解。

题型：

- 5选1的单选题，占比是7-9/10
- 3选多的多选题，约占1-2/10
- 选择句子题

**练习**：建议考生分类训练。在做完一些文章和题目以后，将已经做过的比如50道题做一个题型归类，然后集中30-60分钟左右集中只看比如作用题、选择句子题、取非题，再集中2-3个小时集中看已经做过的逻辑支持、反对、假设等题目。这样就能对解法更加熟悉。

### 3.1 核心题

通常通过寻找各段首句、转折句，通常占3/10。

#### 3.1.1 主题与结构题

主题题**解法**：有TS，定位TS；无TS，则找CS；无CS，则综合各个kw，即综合各个观点，包括表示态度的however句。

题干有如下形式：

- Which of the following statements best **summarizes the main idea** of the passage?
- The author of the passage is **primarily concerned** with discussing

结构题**解法**：综合各段或各观点首句

题干有如下形式：

- The **primary purpose** of the passage is to
- Which of the following is the most accurate description of the **organization**?

#### 3.1.2 态度题

选项为态度词，定位态度句即可：

- 多考负态度
- 让步-转折+态度句基本为必考

#### 3.1.3 写法题

问the author does which of the following? ，按逻辑关系解题；

问哪种方法原文没有使用（EXCEPT），排除法解题。

### 3.2 信息题

难度较大，题目占1-2/10。

发问对象涉及多句或全文内容，*无法精确定位单独某个句子*。例如：

- The author would be likely to agree with which of the following statements regarding the pressure of grazers on phytoplankton numbers? 此处pressure本为某段主题，故全段定位
- The passage supplies information that would answer which of the following questions? 全文定位

**技巧**：

- 从选项找线索，**与文章核心（主题、论点、态度）相背离的首先排除**
  - 此时看选项即可，无需定位（因为有2-3个选项很容易看出是错的）
- 剩下大概2个选项再**精确定位**原文内容。

信息题常常和**多选题**一起出现：

- For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.
- 一定是3选多

### 3.3 定点题

考的最多，占7-8/10。

**做题步骤：**

1. 题干分析：仅读题干
2. 回文定位：仅定位题干
3. 预想答案：定位之后直接将原句改写即为正确答案。**答案为原句的语言变换，有时加上逻辑变换。**
4. 对照选项/在选项中找答案中心词

题干往往出现according to（直接事实）, infer, imply, suggest（取非常见）等词，考察某句内容，不牵涉上下文。定位之后直接将原句改写即为正确答案。

- 细节
- 列举：考文中出现的连续并列
- 态度取非：考文中的态度
- In order to

注：*GRE阅读中，推理并非真正的推理，内容仍来自原文*（或逻辑上保真，最基本的变换）。

#### 细节题/直接事实题

针对某一细节内容发问，约占1-3/10。

解法：

1. 提炼题干名词，比较各段首句KW，确定位段落后再到段中寻找。
2. 答案为定位句的**句法改写、**或说逐字逐句改写，最常见为**同义词改写**。

【Example】Rhetoric, then, is addressed to human beings living at **particular** times and in particular places. From the point of view of rhetoric, we are **not** merely logical thinking machines, creatures abstracted from time and space.

The passage suggests that to consider people as "thinking machines" is to consider them as

(A) beings separated from a historical context

(B) replaceable parts of a larger social machine

(C) more complex than other animals

(D) liars rather than honest people

(E) infallible in their reasoning

解析：选A

#### 列举题

只要能够定位，列举题属于送分题，占0-1/10左右。

- 连续列举：原文连续并列3-4个内容，问哪个有(或没有)提到: mention/cite/refer to/state(EXCEPT) 。常为多选题。
  - 一个精确没有(EXCEPT)的内容，往往与原文的主题、态度无关或相反
- 论据列举：原文存在并列证据，问“作者提到哪个是缺陷（weakness）或理由（reasons）”，答案为并列其中之一。（少见）

**Although** much has been **accomplished** for the modern period, premodern cultures have proved more **difficult**: sources are restricted in number, fragmentary, difficult to interpret, and often contradictory.

All of the following are stated by the author as problems connected with the sources for knowledge of premodern cultures EXCEPT

(A) partial completeness

(B) restricted accessibility

(C) difficulty of interpretation

(D) limited quantity

(E) tendency toward contradiction

解析：选B，其余四项一一对应。

#### 取非题

##### 态度取非

10道题占大约1-2/10。题干问如果怎样，文中某个观点会得到改进：if…, would have been more convincing / would be improved。Would/might/could与AW+一起，暗示发问对象AW-。

解法：定位缺陷、找出原因，取非原因或缺陷

原文：

- aw because/if X.
- aw-. X.

题干：woud/ might/could aw+

答案：~x

- A because/if x
- would -A: -x

【Example】The first theories of such grazer control were merely based on observations of **negative correlations** between algal and zooplankton numbers. A low number of algal cells in the presence of a high number of grazers suggested, but did not prove, that the grazers had removed most of the algae.

It can be inferred from the passage that the “first theories” of grazer control *would have been more convincing* if researchers *had been* able to

(A) observe high phytoplankton numbers under natural lake conditions

(B) discover negative correlations between algae and zooplankton numbers from their field research

(C) understand the central importance of environmental factors in controlling the growth rates of phytoplankton
(D) make verifiable correlations of cause and effect between zooplankton and phytoplankton numbers
(E) invent laboratory techniques that would have allowed them to bypass their field research concerning grazer control

解析：对负评价（suggested, but did not prove）后的X取非即可，选D。

【Example】For example, the **spiral arrangement** of scale-bract complexes on ovule-bearing pine cones, where the female reproductive organs of conifers are located, **is important to** the **production of airflow patterns** that spiral over the cone's surfaces, thereby passing airborne pollen from one scale to the next. **However**, *these patterns cannot be viewed as an adaptation to wind pollination* because the spiral arrangement occurs in a number of non-wind-pollinated plant lineages and is regarded as a characteristic of vascular plants, of which conifers are only one kind, as a whole.

It can be inferred from the passage that the claim that the spiral arrangement of scale-bract complexes on an ovule-bearing pine cone is an adaptation to wind pollination *would be more convincing* if which of the following *were* true?

(A) Such an arrangement occurred only in wind-pollinated plants.

(B) Such an arrangement occurred in vascular plants as a whole.

(C) Such an arrangement could be shown to be beneficial to pollen release.

(D) The number of bracts could be shown to have increased over time.

(E) The airflow patterns over the cone's surfaces could be shown to be produced by such arrangements.

解析：对负评价（However）后的X取非即可，选A。

##### 观点取非

题干虽然没有态度词，但有would、might或could将原文某句部分内容取非，则答案将该句另一部分取非。写成公式就是：

- 原文：A:B
- 题干：would not A
- 答案：would not B。

##### 对比取非

对比取非题针对原文任意一个出现对比的句子出题。可以归入细节题。

原文有内容对比：different, distinction, compare, distinguish, unlike, not found, absent, first, the most; more/less，或者时间对比：early-later, traditionally-now, until recently-recent。

题干常有differ from, distinguish, compare, characteristic, feature等词，都可暗示对比。

解法： 

- 原文A-B相反，问A，取非B；问B，取非A，答案常有否定词；
- 或者，原文说A>B，答案说B<A。

#### In order to/作用题

极度常考的题型，接近核心题的出现频率，10道题占1-3/10。

针对原文任何内容，问其在语境中或上下文（context）的作用，反映了文章内部的各个层次的典型逻辑关系。

在机考界面下，对所问的内容，原文常有黑体提示，定位容易。

题干：问句子成分,句子/例子或证据/a/b, 论点/kw *in order to/ serve... function/ is intended to / is used to*

解法：**逻辑上一层**

- 句子成分（np, v-ing, that）→句子主干（SVO）
- 句子（a/b/c）→论点（kw/cs）
- 观点（kw）→主题（TS/TW）

对比的作用

- 原文：x vs. y
- 题干：x serves to?
- 答案：1. contrast with y, not y. 2. emphasize y.

让步的作用

- 原文：kw.a.b.~x=~kw, x=but kw.
- 题干：\~kw/\~x serves to?
- 答案：1. qualify kw. 2. contrast with x. 3. strengthen kw indirectly; anticipate objection

【Example】In spite of such omissions, what Rosenblatt does include in his discussion makes for an astute and worthwhile study. Black Fiction surveys *a wide variety* of novels, bringing to our attention in the process some fascinating and little-known works like James Weldon Johnson’s Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man.

The author of the passage refers to James Weldon Johnson’s Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man most probably in order to

(A) point out affinities between Rosenblatt’s method of thematic analysis and earlier criticism

(B) clarify the point about expressionistic style made earlier in the passage

(C) qualify the assessment of Rosenblatt’s book made in the first paragraph of the passage

(D) illustrate the affinities among Black novels disclosed by Rosenblatt’s literary analysis

(E) give a specific example of one of the accomplishments of Rosenblatt’s work

解析：应和a wide variety大致同义，选E。

【Example】The predator is searchingly aggressive, inner-directed, tuned by the nervous system and the adrenal hormones, but aware in a sense **closer to** human consciousness **than**, say, a hungry lizard’s instinctive snap at a passing beetle.

The author refers to a hungry lizard primarily in order to

(A) demonstrate the similarity between the hunting methods of mammals and those of nonmammals

(B) broaden the application of the argument by including an insectivore as an example

(C) make a distinction between higher and lower levels of consciousness

(D) provide an additional illustration of the brutality characteristic of predators

(E) offer an objection to suggestions that all animals lack consciousness

解析：distinction是closer than ... to ... 的逻辑改写，选D。

#### 选择句子题

要求考生在文章中选出一个句子，该句子表现了题干所问的功能。

在机考时，只要鼠标点中所在句子的任意一个单词，整个句子、直到句号就会被刷黑。

题干通常会有2-3个结构要素，每个要素涉及1个句子，要做出正确答案，就要理解好几个句子的功能作用，而不只是单独某个句子而已。

- 主题/TW,TS
- 结论/cs
- 论点/kw 态度/aw
- 论据/a/b/ support, evidence, example
  - 最常见！
  - Select the sentence that provides support (a/b) for an answer(kw) to a question(TW)
- *对比/distinguish
- *让步/qualify(限制)

### 3.4 推理题

#### 逻辑题

通常单独针对50字左右的段落出题，而且只出一题。特定情况下，也会针对正常阅读文章中的某些句子出逻辑题。

##### 逻辑反对

题干：if true, would *weaken/ undermine/ cast doubt on* a certain theory/argument in the passage

解法：

1. 反对原因；反对关系。如果原文说a→b；反对原因，就是说a不存在，或者说a不存在时也存在b；a不变时b还在变化，总之说得与己有理论不同；反对关系，有时也被称为抬扛法，则是说a -/->b.
2. 有它因。原文是a→b；如果有其他因素如X存在，可以产生b,就提供了一个竞争原因，这时原来的原因会被一定程度上削弱，符合would weaken。

【Example】Phinney estimates that the probability of these rocks hitting Mars is about one-tenth as great as that of Mars's rocks hitting Earth. To demonstrate this estimate, Phinney used a computer to calculate where 1,000 hypothetical particles would go **if** ejected from Earth in random directions. He found that 17 of the 1,000 particles would hit Mars.

Which of the following, if true, would cast most doubt on Phinney's estimate of the probability of Earth rocks hitting Mars?

A. Rather than going in random directions, about 25 percent of all particles ejected from Earth go in the same direction into space.

B. Approximately 100 meteorites large enough to make a noticeable crater hit the Earth each year.

C. No rocks of Earth origin have been detected on Mars.

D. The velocity of rocks escaping from Earth's gravity is lower than the velocity of meteorites hitting the Earth.

E. No craters more than 60 miles across have been found on Mars.

解析：对 if 条件取非，选A。

##### 逻辑支持

逻辑支持题比逻辑反对题更难，反对的方法单一，但支持的答案就很多。事实上，任何能够帮助推理过程成立的说法都可以构成对原文推理的支持。

题干：if true, would *support/ strengthen* a certain theory/argument in the passage.

**解法**：

1. **直接支持**：*支持论据；举例或重复；提供中间坏节；取非反对论据*。如果原文说a→b,支持论据，的确有a存在；举例或重复，真的发现有a的时候也有b，或者a的某个变化引起了b的变化；提供中间环节，a会产生x，而x会导致b；取非反对论据，通常只对正常阅读文章的论点x与负评价态度aw-: m的结构出题，要支持x,可以以取非负评价的证据方式进行： if not m.
2. **间接支持**：*无它因*。对原文a→b的理论或论证，指出在存在x→b,则a→b的关系被质疑，其可能性降低。

【Example】Authorities in California required drivers to use their headlights on a certain road during the daytime as well as at night and found that annual accident rates on the road fell 15 percent from the previous level. They **concluded** that applying the daytime rule statewide would lead to a similar reduction in accidents.

Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the authorities' argument?

(A) Because an alternate route became available, the volume of traffic on the test road decreased during the test period.

(B) Drivers were informed of the requirement to use their headlights on the test road by means of a series of three conspicuous signs in each direction of travel.

(C) Under certain conditions, among them fog and heavy rain, most drivers in California already use their headlights during the daytime.

(D) Full-scale application of the daytime rule would cause headlight bulbs to burn out sooner than they currently do and thus to require more frequent replacement.

(E) The test road was selected to include a great variety of the sorts of road conditions that drivers in California are likely to encounter.

解析：选E，其中A反对，E支持，BCD与选项基本无关。

【Example】Whereas neither farmers nor the potential urban purchasers benefited from the restriction on the free alienation of rural lands delineated in the Rural Land Act, there was one group that would benefit: the bureaucrats who implement and administer the incomplete property rights system of land.

Which of the following, if true, would support the author’s assertion about the true motivation for the passage of the Rural Land Act?

(A) The legislators who voted for the Rural Land Act owned land in rural area.

(B) The majority of farmers who own their land did not sell their land to potential urban purchasers.

(C) The legislators who voted for Rural Land Act were heavily influenced by the bureaucrats.

(D) Farmers managed to preserve their custom and culture despite the impact of industrialization.

(E) Urban purchasers who bought a lot of plots of rural land consolidated them into huge farms.

解析：选C。

##### 中间环节：假设、调和差异、完成推理

题干：*assumption/ explain the difference / reconcile the discrepancy, resolve the paradox, complete the paragraph / complete the argument*？

解法：

- 找出论证的条件或中间环节
- 注意通常不能与原文重复

【Example】During the day in Lake Constance, the zooplankton D. hyalina departs for the depths where food is scarce and the water cold. D. galeata remains near the warm surface where food is abundant. Even though D. galeata grows and reproduces much faster, its population is often outnumbered by D. hyalina.

Which of the following, if true, would help resolve the apparent paradox presented above?

(A) The number of species of zooplankton living at the bottom of the lake is twice that of species living at the surface.

(B) Predators of zooplankton, such as whitefish and perch, live and feed near the surface of the lake during the day.

(C) In order to make the most of scarce food resources, D. hyalina matures more slowly than D. galeata.

(D) D. galeata clusters under vegetation during the hottest part of the day to avoid the Sun’s rays.

(E) D. galeata produces twice as many offspring per individual in any given period of time as does D. hyalina.

解析：选B，ACE都是对原文的重复、具体化。

#### 类比

在极少数情况下，考题会针对原文的一个命题问与其类似的情况。在目前看到的题目里，都没有单独的类比题。

题干： similar, analogous to, parallel, consistent with

解法：抽掉具体名词，保留关系与态度(v.，adj.，抽象名词)

【Example】Although recent years have seen **substantial reductions** in noxious pollutants from **individual** motor vehicles, the **number** of such vehicles has been steadily **increasing**. **Consequently**, more than 100 cities in the United States still have levels of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and ozone (generated by photochemical reactions with hydrocarbons from vehicle exhaust) that **exceed** legally established limits.

Which of the following most closely *parallels* the situation described in the *first sentence* of the passage?

(A) Although a town reduces its public services in order to avoid a tax increase, the town's tax rate exceeds that of other towns in the surrounding area.

(B) Although a state passes strict laws to limit the type of toxic material that can be disposed of in public landfills, illegal dumping continues to increase.

(C) Although a town's citizens reduce their individual use of water, the town's water supplies continue to dwindle because of a steady increase in the total population of the town.

(D) Although a country attempts to increase the sale of domestic goods by adding a tax to the price of imported goods, the sale of imported goods within the country continues to increase.

(E) Although a country reduces the speed limit on its national highways, the number of fatalities caused by automobile accidents continues to increase.

解析：加粗的单词为需要保留的单词，选C。

### 3.5 选项与定位

为了能够熟练定位，建议考生花2-3个小时时间，集中看50-60道题题干 ，不看选项，只看题干什么题型、什么解法、如何定位。任何技能，经过专业的集中训练之后，都可以再精进一步。

为了提高对选项的认知，我们建议考生花3个小时左右，集中看50-60道题的200-300个选项 。选项所在的题目都是已经做过的，但做完题了还需要反复练习，才能烂熟于心，考试时达到自动反应的程度。

## Examples

### Mendelssohn

Was Felix Mendelssohn (1809–1847) a great composer? On its face, the question seems absurd. One of the most gifted prodigies in the history of music, he produced his first masterpiece at sixteen. From then on, he was recognized as an artist of preternatural abilities, not only as a composer but also as a pianist and conductor. But Mendelssohn’s enduring popularity has often been at odds — sometimes quite sharply — with his critical standing. Despite general acknowledgment of his genius, there has been a noticeable reluctance to rank him with, **say**, Schumann or Brahms. As Haggin put it, Mendelssohn, as a composer, was a “minor master . . . working on a small scale of emotion and texture.”

| Function       | Core                 |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| T              | M?                   |
| kw1. a b       | great+.(+,+)         |
| vs. kw2. x. y. | critical: -(<S.B. H) |

1.The passage suggests that anyone attempting to evaluate Mendelssohn’s career must confront which of the following **dichotomies**?

A. The tension between Mendelssohn’s career as a composer and his career as a pianist and conductor

B. The contrast between Mendelssohn’s popularity and that of Schumann and Brahms

C. The discrepancy between Mendelssohn’s popularity and his standing among critics

D. The inconsistency between Mendelssohn’s reputation during his lifetime and his reputation since his death

E. The gap between Mendelssohn’s prodigious musical beginnings and his decline in later years

解析：对应到原文的**转折句(kw2)**，But Mendelssohn’s enduring popularity has often been at odds — sometimes quite sharply — with his critical standing，选C

2.The author mentions Schumann and Brahms primarily in order to

A. provide examples of composers who are often compared with Mendelssohn

B. identify certain composers who are more popular than Mendelssohn

C. composers whom Mendelssohn influenced

D. establish the milieu in which Mendelssohn worked

E. establish a standard of comparison for Mendelssohn as a composer

解析：对应原文的**论据x**，Despite general acknowledgment of his genius, there has been a noticeable reluctance to rank him with, say, Schumann or Brahms. 其中say有举例的意思，选C。

注意，干扰项A中often错误，不符合事实！

### Transportation of Seeds

Since the Hawaiian Islands have never been connected to other land masses, the great variety of plants in Hawaii must be a result of the long-distance dispersal of seeds, a process that requires both a method of transport and an **equivalence** between the ecology of the source area and that of the recipient area. There is some **dispute** about the method of transport involved. Some biologists argue that ocean and air **currents** are responsible for the transport of plant seeds to Hawaii. Yet the results of flotation experiments and the low temperatures of air currents cast **doubt** on these hypotheses. More probable is **bird** transport, either externally, by accidental attachment of the seeds to feathers, or internally, by the swallowing of fruit and subsequent excretion of the seeds. While it is likely that fewer varieties of plant seeds have reached Hawaii externally than internally, more varieties are known to be adapted to external than to internal transport.

**现象解释型**文章

| Cues            | Function  | Core        |
| --------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| the result of   | TW        | dispersal   |
| dispute         | TW'(补充) | dispute     |
| Some biologists | kw1       | current     |
| Yet... doubt    | aw-       | doubt       |
| More probable   | kw2+      | bird+       |
| ...             | (X)       | (6.ex-/in-) |

1.The author of the passage is **primarily concerned with**

A. discussing different approaches biologists have taken to testing theories about the distribution of plants in Hawaii

B. discussing different theories about the transport of plant seeds to Hawaii

C. discussing the extent to which air currents are responsible for the dispersal of plant seeds to Hawaii

D. resolving a dispute about the adaptability of plant seeds to bird transport

E. resolving a dispute about the ability of birds to carry plant seeds long distances

解析：**主题题**，选B

2.The author mentions the results of flotation experiments on plant seeds most probably **in order to**

A. support the claim that the distribution of plants in Hawaii is the result of the long-distance dispersal of seeds

B. lend credibility to the thesis that air currents provide a method of transport for plant seeds to Hawaii

C. suggest that the long-distance dispersal of seeds is a process that requires long periods of time

D. challenge the claim that ocean currents are responsible for the transport of plant seeds to Hawaii

E. refute the claim that Hawaiian flora evolved independently from flora in other parts of the world

解析：**作用题**，D
