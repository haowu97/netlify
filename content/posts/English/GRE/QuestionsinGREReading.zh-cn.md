#### 例题

议论文主旨题例题（1/3）：第一篇
 
🔺Attempts to identify New Guinea’s hunter-gatherers face the **well-known** difficulty of defining what constitutes a hunter-gatherer group. According to the common definition, hunter-gatherers are those who subsist by hunting wild animals and gathering wild plants. **Yet** those who subsist by hunting wild animals and gathering wild issue of what constitutes “wild”. The very presence on a landscape of humans who are consumers affects food resources, blurring the lines between wild and domesticated and, hence, between hunting and pastoralism and between gathering and cultivation. Moreover, it is unclear how groups should be classified that are hunter-gatherers in their procurement strategies but that make use of pastoralism and cultivation in their consumption patterns—subsisting, for example, by trading wild foods to neighbors in return for domesticated crops.

The primary purpose of the passage is to

A. suggest that there are not as many hunter-gatherers in New Guinea as is commonly thought

B. explain why identifying New Guinea’s hunter-gatherers is not a straightforward process

C. point to certain difficulties in establishing what constitutes a wild plant and a wild animal

D. establish new, more relevant criteria for what constitutes a hunter-gatherer group

E. discuss the implications of an inappropriate definition of pastoralism

解析：单一观点，观点在第一句，选 B。

第二篇

**Historian Colin Calloway** argues that in the late colonial period preceding the American Revolution (1775-1783), the British government sought to seal off territory west of the Appalachian Mountain from the encroachment of land-hungry White settlers, to negotiate with Native American peoples as independent foreign states, and to guarantee the integrity of traditional native American hunting grounds. By contrast, White Americans, released by the outbreak of the Revolution from the constraints of Britain’s allegedly benevolent policies, are portrayed by Calloway as ruthless land-grabbers whose new national government endorsed their rapacity.
 
**Bernard Bailyn argues**, **however**, that the “Americans” who encroached on Native American land during the Revolution had been British only a few years before. When, during and after the Revolution, White Americans seized Native American land by any available means, they were continuing a tradition dating back to the earliest years of English settlement in North America. And, according to Bailyn, the British government’s prewar efforts to preserve the trans-Appalachian west for Native Americans resulted not from humanitarian virtue or ethnic tolerance but from British Merchants’ desire to maintain their lucrative trade with native Americans and the government’ s desire to control immigration and avoid costly conflict between White and Native Americans over land.

The primary purpose of the passage is to

A. suggest that two different arguments about a particular historical period are both questionable

B. present historical evidence that undermines a widely accepted viewpoints

C. defend a revisionist historian’s thesis against traditionalist criticism

D. outline opposing interpretations of a particular historical phenomenon

E. resolve a dispute among historians over a controversial historical episode

解析：对立观点，选 D。

议论文主旨题例题（2/3）：第三篇
 
The “deindustrialization” thesis of **Bluestone and Harrison** **asserts** that the replacement of domestic with foreign manufacturing begun by United States corporations in the late 1960s resulted in a “hollowing out” of American industry, whereby workers displaced from manufacturing jobs through massive plant closings found themselves moving more or less permanently into lower-paying, less secure jobs or into unemployment. **Critics** of the deindustrialization thesis have **argued** that new service and high-technology sectors of the United States economy have recently created a substantial number of jobs. While these critics do not deny the painful aspects of this transition from an industrial to a service-and information- based economy, they argue that it will be short-term, and a necessary evil if the United States is to have long-term increases in living standards. **Critics** of the emerging economy, however, **point to** disturbing evidence of an “hourglass” effect: a shrinking middle tier of managerial and blue-collar unionized workers and consequent polarization of incomes. The emergence of a technical and financial elite, they argue, has brought forth a host of low-wage jobs to service the new economy, and it is this service sector that many ex-industrial workers must seek.

The purpose of the passage is to

A. analyze the events that contributed to an economic phenomenon

B. present different views on the nature and impact of an economic phenomenon

C. distinguish between the short-term and long-term effects of an economic phenomenon

D. challenge a dominant theory about how to solve the problems created by an economic phenomenon

E. present new evidence to suggest that an economic phenomenon is more complex than had previously been believed

解析：各执己见，主旨是三个观点以及三个观点之间的关系，选 B。

第四篇
 
**Ecologists had assumed** that trees in the consistently warm tropics grew at a slow but steady rate, unvarying from year to year. However, **a study at La Selva, Costa Rica, showed that** trees grew less in hotter years and more in cooler ones: between 1984 and 2000, dramatic differences occurred in the six species of trees studies, with trees adding twice as much wood in some cooler years as they did in the scorching El Nino year of 1997-1998. Because tree growth is an index of the balance between photosynthesis, in which trees absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and release oxygen, and respiration, in which the opposite occurs, the La Selva data were the first hint that rapidly rising global temperatures, driven by human-generated emissions of CO2, may be pushing tropical forests to release more CO2, thereby intensifying global warming. This **raised serious questions about a popular theory** that tropical forests act as a sponge, soaking up much of the excess CO2 that humans pump into the atmosphere. The La Selva data are consistent with a model of global CO2 flux developed by **Keeling, who concluded** that the amount of CO2 taken up in tropical landmasses rose in cooler years and fell in hotter ones, accounting for year-to-year changes in the amount of CO2 that stays in the atmosphere.

The primary purpose of the passage is to

A. present additional evidence to support a popular theory

B. show the underlying similarities of two seemingly contradictory theories

C. point out the implications of a particular study for two related theories

D. provide an alternative explanation for a well-documented phenomenon

E. reconcile two competing theories that explain a phenomenon

解析：众星捧月，选 C，implication 表示重要意义以及影响。

议论文主旨题例题（3/3）：第五篇
 
[1] The history of the transmission of ancient Roman texts prior to invention of the printing press is reconstructed from **evidence both internal and external** to the texts themselves. **Internal evidence** is used to reconstruct the relationship of the surviving manuscripts of a Roman text to one another, as represented in a modern stemma codicum: a diagram depicting the genealogical relationship of surviving manuscripts and those the stemmas editor believes existed at one time. **Stemma** are scholar’s only road maps to textual connections based on internal evidence, but they **may paint a distorted picture** of reality because they diagram the relationships of only those manuscripts known or inferred today. If surviving copies are few, the stemma perforce brings into proximity manuscripts that were widely separated in time and place of origin. Conversely, the stemma can also bestow a semblance of separation on manuscripts written within a few months of one another or even in the same room.

[2] **One type of external evidence** that may shed light on the transmission of Roman texts is the availability of a work in the Middle Ages, when many classical texts were circulated. Too often, though, too much is inferred about a particular works circulation in the Middle Ages from the number of manuscripts surviving today. When a work survives in a single manuscript copy, editors call the manuscript, rather glamorously, the lone survivor–implying that all its (presumably rare) companions were destroyed sometime early in the Middle Ages by pillaging barbarians. It is equally possible that the work survived far into the Middle Ages in numerous copies in monastic libraries but were unnoticed due to lack of interest. The number of extant manuscripts, however few, really does not allow **scholars** to infer how many ancient Latin manuscripts of a work survived to the ninth, the twelfth, or even the fifteenth century.

[3] Quotations from a Roman text by a medieval author are another category of **external evidence**: but does the appearance of a rare word or grammatical construction—or even a short passage—really indicate a medieval author’s firsthand knowledge of this or that ancient work, or does such usage instead derive from some intermediate source, such as a grammar book or a popular style manual? Medieval authors do quote extensively from ancient authors; while such quotations provide some evidence of the works medieval circulation, as well as define its evolving fortunes and the various uses to which it was put, they may be **far less useful in reconstructing** the text of an ancient work.

[4] Much as **scholars** want to look for overall patterns and formulate useful generalizations, the transmission of each text is a different story and each manuscripts history is unique. Scholars must be careful not to draw conclusions that go beyond what the evidence can support.
 
The passage is primarily concerned with which of the following?

A. tracing certain changes in the methods used to study the transmission of ancient Roman texts.

B. contrasting two types of evidence used in investigating the transmission of ancient Roman texts.

C. outlining certain difficulties associated with studying the transmission of ancient Roman texts.

D. advocating the use of one type of evidence about ancient Roman texts over the use of another type.

E. explaining the development and potential uses and drawbacks of stemma in the study of ancient Roman texts.

解析：选 C。

### 1.2 说明文主旨题

如何确定说明文体裁：通读文章，发现**没有明确的观点，只是对现象、事实等的介绍**。

如何解决说明文主旨题？

1. 对于自然科学文章：我们需要找到介绍主题，通常会开门见山。
2. 对于社会科学文章：尤其是历史类文章，我们需要找到时间发生的**开端、经过和结果**，尤其对于结果要有准确把握。

说明文主旨题例题：第一篇
 
**Constant variations in the amount of sunlight available on Earth at any given location make energy storage a necessary design feature of terrestrial solar-energy systems**. For systems transforming solar to thermal energy, the thermal energy may be stored in matter as either latent heat or sensible heat. Latent heat is absorbed or released whenever matter changes phase, as when matter changes from liquid to gas, for example, or from gas to liquid. Large heat capacities are associated with certain materials, like salts, but in any substance this storage is available only at the unique fixed temperature at which the particular phase transition occurs in that substance. Moreover, materials that have transitions at the temperatures that terrestrial solar-energy systems are likely to encounter are usually destructively corrosive at those temperatures. The storage of sensible heat, on the other hand, allows flexibility as to temperature, in addition, safe substances like water and most rocks have large sensible heat capacities.

The primary purpose of the passage is to discuss which of the following?

A. reasons for the necessity for developing solar-energy systems

B. different ways of storing solar energy as heat

C. new designs for devices that collect solar energy

D. procedures for transferring thermal energy between materials

E. differences between capacities of solids and liquids to store sensible heat

解析：自然科学类说明文，看开头即可，选 B。

第二篇

Early in the twentieth century, San Francisco was the main venue for African American jazz musicians on the West Coast of the United States. Musical activity was centered in a district known as the Barbary Coast, where an abundance of nightclubs provided ample work opportunities for local players and drew musicians and other entertainers, many of them African American, from throughout the country. In 1921, as part of its Prohibition-era efforts, the government closed the Barbary Coast. This closure was the decisive event that established Los Angeles as the premier center for jazz on the West Coast. Once the Barbary Coast was shut down, it became far harder for jazz musicians to make a living in San Francisco; thus, many headed south to Los Angeles.
 
Yet even before that closing, the center of jazz activity had begun to swing southward. With the largest and fastest growing African American urban community in the West, as well as the growing movie industry and an emerging recording industry, Los Angeles was already a magnet for jazz musicians from other parts of the country, especially New Orleans, where jazz players suffered a devastating blow with closing of the Storyville district in 1917.

The primary purpose of the passage is to

A. point out the parallel effects on jazz music of governmental actions in San Francisco and New Orleans

B. offer an alternative to the standard explanation for the decline of San Francisco as a jazz center

C. argue for the importance of Californian cities in the development of jazz

D. present and refute an argument about the reasons for a demographic shift in jazz activity

E. outline the factors that contributed to a change in the Geographical locus of jazz activity

解析：社会科学类说明文，讲解美国爵士乐历史，概括起因、经过、结果——关闭旧金山中心，向西转移，洛杉矶成为新的中心，选 E。

细节题例题：第一篇
 
🔺1800 Thomas Dilworth’s New Guide to the English Dialogue was being widely used to teach reading in the United States. Dilworth’s primer, unlike earlier ones, stressed the importance of children’s understanding what they read. While it is in fact unlikely that children would have recognized all the vocabulary Dilworth used, that was at least his stated goal. Dilworth recognized that primers should enable children to decode words from print with the form of language they already knew: speech. In contrast, many *earlier authors* assumed that, just as introductory Latin texts taught children an unknown language, introductory English texts should teach English as if it, too, were an unknown language.

According to the passage, the “earlier authors” adopted a model for English instruction that

A. mirrored the practice used in Latin instruction

B. was originally formulated by Dilworth

C. was less esoteric than that adopted by Dilworth

D. stressed familiarity with the peculiarities of English spelling

E. emphasized the importance of fluent and articulate speech

解析：定位到最后一句，选 A。

第二篇

🔺Ralph Ellison was passionately interested in visual arts. He immersed himself in Harlem’s art scene in the 1930s, even apprenticing with sculptor Richmond Barthe for a time. Yet he was wary of projects aiming to provide a visual rendering of his novel Invisible Man. He reluctantly allowed Franklin Library to publish two illustrated versions of the novel but found the results disappointing and repeatedly rejected proposed film versions of the book. Despite his involvement in visual arts, Ellison insisted that only language could capture the complexity of American identity. This complexity consisted of the *tension* arising from the collision of the United States’ written ideals, as outlined in the founding documents, and the historical and contemporary experience molding the national consciousness.

Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about the “tension”?

A. It partly resulted from social injustices that Ellison worked to alleviate.

B. It came to Ellison’s attention partly as a result of his experience with proposed film versions of Invisible Man.

C. Ellison thought that it could not be adequately represented by sculpture.
 
D. Ellison believed that it arose from contradictions within the United States’ founding ideals.

E. Ellison felt that it was an issue that could not adequately be addressed through the depiction of fictional characters.

解析：定位到最后两句，选 C。

第三篇

The novel Georges, published under Alexander Dumas’ name, **may** actually have been written by Felicien Mallefille. A comparison of Georges with well-known Dumas novels such as The Count of Monte Cristo suggests that Dumas had little to do with Georges. For example, Georges’ characters are tiresomely earnest, while those from Dumas’ well-known novels crack jokes and utter colorful oaths. Meanwhile, in a technical sense, Georges is well-written, while The Count of Monte Cristo, with all its verve and sparkle, is full of redundancies, repetitions, and non sequiturs. As Umberto Eco discovered while attempting to translate The Count of Monte Cristo, the charm of Dumas’ novel and its “narrative wisdom” are inseparable from its “linguistically sludgy and gasping” prose.

The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which of the following statements about Dumas as a novelist?

A. His use of non sequiturs detracts from the stylistic verve of his writing.

B. His use of repetition has been overrated as effective novelistic technique.

C. His reliance on humor results in one-dimensional characters.

D. His novels, while technically well written, have predictable plots.

E. His writing displays narrative skill despite certain technical flaws.

解析：Dumas 为全文关键词，需要通读全文，然后定位到后两句，选 E。选项 A detract 没有；选项 B overrate无中生有；选项 CD 均为无中生有

A divide between aesthetic and technical considerations has played a crucial role in mapmaking and cartographic scholarship. Since nineteenth century cartographers, for instance, understood themselves as technicians who did not care about visual effects, while others saw themselves as landscape painters. That dichotomy structured the discipline of the history of cartography. Until the 1980s, in what Blakemore and Harley called “the Old is Beautiful **Paradigm**,” scholars largely focused on maps made before 1800, marveling at their beauty and sometimes regretting the decline of the pre-technical age. Early mapmaking was considered art while modern cartography was located within the realm of engineering utility. Alpers, however, has argued that this boundary would have puzzled mapmakers in the seventeenth century, because they considered themselves to be visual engineers.

According to the passage, Alpers would **say that** the assumptions underlying the “paradigm” were

A. inconsistent with the way some mapmakers prior to 1800 understand their own work

B. dependent on a seventeenth-century conception of mapmaking visual engineering
 
C. unconcerned with the difference between the aesthetic and technical questions of mapmaking

D. insensitive to divisions among cartographers working in the period after 1800

E. supported by the demonstrable technical superiority of mapmaking made after 1800

解析：定位到最后两句，选 A。

例题：第一篇

🔺A divide between aesthetic and technical considerations has played a crucial role in mapmaking and cartographic scholarship. Since nineteenth century cartographers, for instance, understood themselves as technicians who did not care about visual effects, while others saw themselves as landscape painters. That dichotomy structured the discipline of the history of cartography. Until the **1980s**, in what Blakemore and Harley called “the Old is Beautiful Paradigm,” scholars largely focused on maps made before 1800, marveling at their beauty and sometimes regretting the decline of the pre-technical age. Early mapmaking was considered art while modern cartography was located within the realm of engineering utility. Alpers, however, has argued that this boundary would have puzzled mapmakers in the seventeenth century, because they considered themselves to be visual engineers.

It can be inferred from the passage that, beginning in the 1980s, historians of cartography

A. placed greater emphasis on the beauty of maps made after 1800

B. expanded their range of study to include more material created after 1800

C. grew more sensitive to the way mapmakers prior to 1800 conceived of their work

D. came to see the visual details of maps as aesthetic objects rather than practical cartographic aids

E. reduced the attention they paid to the technical aspects of mapmaking

解析：until 表示直到...时候，意味着在...之前，beginning in the 1980s，属于反向思维推理题，反向改写原句，选 B。

第二篇
 
🔺Early naturalists believed two species of beaver lived in North America: dam beavers and bank beavers. The bank species was thought to resemble the muskrat in behavior, living in burrows or lodges and unable to build dams. In fact, dams are primarily a strategy for dealing with annual variations in water levels. If water levels fall in summer, as they do in most of North America, then beavers lodge entrances may be exposed. With stabilized water levels, their homes are much safer. Along deep rivers, where bank beavers are found, this problem seldom arises. But these beavers do know how to build dams, and do so if the need arises, as may occur if they are forced to relocate after felling and consuming all nearby trees.

The passage implies which of the following about beavers?

A. Bank beavers are unable to successfully compete with dam beavers when resources become scarce.

B. Differences in dam-building behavior among beavers do not necessarily imply multiple beaver species.

C. Building dams eventually causes beavers to deplete nearby resources.

D. When conditions permit, beavers are more likely to build dams than burrows or lodges.

E. In beavers, dam-building is an acquired rather than an innate skill.

解析：根据最后一句 bank beavers do know how to build dams，选 B。

第三篇

🔺Early life insurers in the United States found themselves facing the problem of obtaining reliable information, as they needed to rely on applicants themselves to provide truthful, complete answers to a standard set of questions. In an attempt to personalize the relationship between insurers and their individual applicants, firms selected highly respected local citizens to act as their agents. These agents were expected to evaluate the appearance of candidates, unearth evidence of unhealthy family histories or questionable habits, and attest to the respectability of the people writing testimonial letters on an applicant’s behalf. In short, the initial purpose of the agency system was not to actively solicit customers, but, rather, to recreate the glass-bowl mentality associated with small towns or **city neighborhoods**.

The author suggests which of the following about “city neighborhoods”?

A. They were places where family histories were difficult to establish.

B. They were places where unhealthy behaviors had been successfully addressed.

C. They were locations that were well suited for recruiting insurance agents.
 
D. They offered a high degree of transparency about a resident’s personal history and character.

E. They offered potentially fruitful markets for the life insurance industry.

解析：属于对修辞的解读，glass-bowl 表示玻璃碗内的东西一清二楚，选 D。

例题

Biologist know that some marine algae can create clouds by producing the gas dimethyl sulphide (DMS), which reacts with oxygen in air above the sea to form solid particles. These particles provide a surface on which water vapor can condense to form clouds. **Lovelock contends** that this process is part of global climatic-control system. According to Lovelock, Earth acts like a super organism, with all its biological and physical systems cooperating to keep it healthy. He hypothesized that warmer conditions increase **algal** activity and DMS output, seeding more clouds, which cool the planet by blocking out the Sun. Then, as the climate cools, algal activity and DMS level decrease and the cycle continues. In response to biologists who question how organisms presumably working for their own selfish ends could have evolved to behave in a way that benefits not only the planet but the organisms as well, Lovelock points out that cooling benefits the algae, which remain at the ocean surface, because it allows the cooled upper layers of the ocean to sink, and then the circulating water carries nutrients upward from the depths below. Algae may also benefit from nitrogen raining down from clouds they have helped to form.

Which of the following is most similar to the role played by marine algae in the global climate control system proposed by Lovelock?

A. a fan that continually replaces stale air in a room with fresh air from outside.
 
B. a thermostat that automatically controls an air-conditioning system.

C. an insulating blanket that retains heat.

🔺Astronomers who study planet formation once believed that comets—because they remain mostly in the distant Oort cloud, where temperatures are close to absolute zero—must be pristine relics of the material that formed the outer planets. The conceptual shift away from seeing comets as pristine relics began in the 1970s, when **laboratory simulations** revealed there was sufficient ultraviolet radiation reaching comets to darken their surfaces and there were sufficient cosmic rays to alter chemical bonds or even molecular structure near the surface. Nevertheless, astronomers still believed that when a comet approached the Sun—where they could study it—the Sun’s intense heat would remove the corrupted surface layer, exposing the interior. About the same time, though, scientists realized comets might contain decaying radioactive isotopes that could have warmed cometary interiors to temperatures that caused the interiors to evolve.

Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.

It can be inferred that the author would agree with which of the following statements about the “laboratory simulations”?

A. The simulations showed that despite the low temperatures in the Oort cloud, there was sufficient energy there to alter comets.

B. Astronomers were initially reluctant to accept what simulations showed about the composition of comets.

C. The simulations themselves did not eliminate the possibility that comets contain pristine relics of material from the early solar system.

背景：Oort cloud 在太阳系的最外圈，温度很低。

解析：只是表面背改变，选 AC。

Recent studies of the gender gap in the history of United States policies tend to focus on candidate choice rather than on registration and turnout. This shift in focus from gender inequality in political participation may be due to the finding in several studies of voting behavior in the United States that since 1980, differences in rates of registration and voting between men and women are not statistically significant after controlling for traditional predictors of participation. However, Fullerton and Stern argue that researchers have overlooked the substantial gender gap in registration and voting in the South. While the gender gap in participation virtually disappeared outside the South by the 1950s, substantial gender differences persisted in the South throughout the 1950s and 1960s, only beginning to decline in 1970s.

作用题之“描述”类例题：第一篇
 
Some historians question the widely held belief that continually improving education led to gradual African American empowerment in the southern United States from the late nineteenth century through the mid-twentieth century. They note that the development of Black educational institutions in the segregated South was never rapid or steady: <u>disparities between Black and White schools sometimes grew in the early decades of the twentieth century</u>. And African Americans’ educational gains did not bring commensurate economic gains. Starting in the 1940s, even as Black and White schools in the South moved steadily toward equality, Black southerners remained politically marginalized and experienced systematic job discrimination.

Although Black schools had achieved near parity with White schools in per capita spending and teachers’ salaries by 1965, African Americans’ income still lagged behind that of Whites. Nonetheless, educational progress did contribute toward economic and political empowerment. African Americans’ campaigns to support Black schools fostered a sense of community, nurtured political determination, and often increased literacy. More significantly, politically outspoken Black newspapers achieved record circulation during the 1940s, just as the literacy rate among African Americans approached 90 percent.

Finally, the leadership of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s was composed largely of graduates of Black colleges.

The author of the passage refers to the fact that “disparities between Black and White schools sometimes grew in the early decades of the twentieth century” most likely in order to

A. support the argument that the economic struggles of southern Blacks were largely due to educational inequalities

B. give an example of the differences between Black schools in the early part of the twentieth century and Black schools starting in the 1940s

C. illustrate the unevenness of the progress made by Black schools in the southern United States

D. help explain why Black remained politically marginalized and experienced systematic job discrimination in the segregated South

E. provide evidence that educational progress was a precondition for economic progress in the segregated South

解析：选 C。

Before feminist literary criticism emerged in the 1970s, the nineteenth-century United States writer Fanny Fern was regarded by most critics (when considered at all) as a prototype of weepy sentimentalism—a pious, insipid icon of conventional American culture. Feminist reclamations of Fern, by contrast, emphasize her nonsentimental qualities, particularly her <u>sharply humorous social criticism</u>. Most feminist scholars find it difficult to reconcile Fern’s sardonic social critiques with her effusive celebrations of many conventional values.

Attempting to resolve this contradiction, Harris concludes that Fern employed flowery rhetoric strategically to disguise her subversive goals beneath apparent conventionality. However, Tompkins proposes an alternative view of sentimentality itself, suggesting that sentimental writing could serve radical, rather than only conservative ends by swaying readers emotionally, moving them to embrace social change.

It can be inferred that the author of the passage mentions Fern’s “sharply humorous social criticism” primarily in order to

A. contrast Fern’s apparent intentions with the impression her writing made on Harris

B. suggest that many feminist critics have attributed to Fern intentions that she may not have had

C. **identify** an aspect of Fern’s writing that strikes some scholars as incompatible with other attributes of her writing

D. help account for the effect Fern’s writing had on critics of her own time

E. identify the aspects of Fern’s writing for which she was primarily known prior to the 1970s

解析：选 C。

第三篇

Federal courts in the United States, especially before the famous 1962 case of Baker v. Carr, were often thought to be powerless in the area of election law, voting rights, and other legal questions clearly bearing on politics. This perception was not entirely correct, of course, as pre-1962 Supreme Court decisions such as that in the case of Smith v. Allwright demonstrated in the wake of that decision, voting participation among African Americans in the South increased substantially.
 
However, political rights had not always been so clearly championed by the Supreme Court as they were in Smith v. Allwright. Indeed, the transformations between the Civil War and 1962 were such that, in reviewing voters’ rights cases over the intervening decades, one feels like an <u>archaeologist</u> cutting through distinct layers in which the judicial decisions uncovered reveal a pattern of ideological and societal change.

The author of the passage uses the analogy of the archaeology most probably in order to

A. contrast judicial decisions made after 1962 concerning voters rights with decision made immediately after the Civil War

B. suggest that the author is perplexed by many judicial decisions regarding voters’ rights

C. characterize the nature of change in judicial thinking regarding voters’ rights

D. indicate that much of the history of voters’ rights has been lost since the Civil War

E. illustrate the lack of concern for voters’ rights exhibited by federal courts before the Civil War

- 举例：马斯克平均每周要工作 100 个小时。
- 这句话的作用是：provide evidence to support the viewpoint that Musk’s efforts are greater than his talent.
 
作用题之“证据/例子”类例题：第一篇

Bat studies in Indiana between 1961 and 1993 recorded bat roost locations. All of the roosts of evening bats were in buildings. <u>Consequently, the fact that all evening bats radio tracked since 1993 have roosted in trees was notable</u>. The building roosts may have been the result of spillover from large populations of evening bats in the woods along rivers, where, prior to 1993, scientific data were not collected. The building roosts may also indicate that this species had adapted well to human structures. However, the disappearance after 1993 of previously known roosts in buildings suggests that this adaptation became less successful. Big brown bat populations have been increasing in Indiana, and perhaps evening bats do not compete successfully with them for roosts in buildings.

The author mentions the fact that evening bats radio-tracked since 1993 have roosted in trees primarily **in order to**

A. account for a puzzling aspect of evening bat behavior mentioned earlier in the passage

B. introduce evidence that indicates a change in evening bat behavior discussed later in the passage

C. undermine a theory about evening bat behavior presented earlier in the passage

D. provide a contrast between evening bat behavior and big brown bat behavior

E. provide an example of evening bat behavior that fits well-established scientific views of the species

解析：观点句在前一句，出现在观点之后，反对原有观点，选 B。

第二篇
 
Animals live longer when their calorie intake is restricted to two-thirds of what is considered normal for their species. Animals so restricted are also generally healthier: most disease, including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative illness, are forestalled. This phenomenon was long attributed to a simple slowing of metabolism (cells’ production of energy from fuel molecules) and consequent reproduction of its toxic by-products in response to less food. In fact, **however**, calorie restriction does not slow mammalian metabolism, and <u>in yeast and worms, metabolism is both sped up and altered</u>. Some scientists now theorize that calorie restriction is a biological stressor that, like natural food scarcity, induces a more complex defensive response, which in mammals includes changes in cellular defenses and repair.

In the passage, the function of the highlighted portion is to

A. provide specific examples of organisms whose longevity does not increase in response to calorie restriction.

B. illustrate the probable means by which organisms placed on a calorie-restriction diet compensate for the reduction in available food-based level.

C. suggest the mechanism that is responsible for prolonging the life of organism whose calorie intake is significantly reduced.

D. give an example that explain why scientists’ thinking about the physiological effects of calorie
restriction changed.

E. distinguish the different ways that mammalian and non-mammalian metabolisms respond to significant reductions in calorie intake
Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply.

解析：前后两句均有观点，反对之前的观点，引出后面的观点，选 D。

### 2.3 “提出观点/假设”类

**文章中表示“提出观点/假设”的句型和关系**：**准确识别观点句**（与做主旨题的过程相似）。

**选项中表示“提出观点/假设”的写作目的动词**：**offer a hypothesis、present a viewpoint** 等。

- 举例：The color of the sky on Mars **might** be actually blue as on Earth.

- 这句话的作用是：present a hypothesis of the color of the sky on Mars

补充几个**词汇辨析**

a. **theory 表示理论**

- 是对一个科学命题的综合的、系统化的理解与认知，可以指导实践。

b. **hypothesis、speculation 表示猜测**

- 范围更小，确定性更弱。一个*理论（theory）中经常包括多个相关的猜测*。

c. **viewpoint 表示观点**

- 这个词更常出现在社会科学主题中，特点是主观的、带有猜测的，与 hypothesis、speculation 没有本质的不同。

d. **conclusion 表示结论**

- *结论并不等于事实，所以结论也是观点或猜测的一种*，也是存在不确定性的。

作用题之“提出观点/假设”类例题
 
Migratory songbirds breeding in Eurasia’s temperate forests depend on a summer flush of insects, particularly caterpillars, to feed themselves and their offspring. In some places, these caterpillars are emerging earlier in responses to rising global temperatures. <u>In theory, the songbirds could simply push up their departure from their winter quarters to catch the earlier flush of insect prey</u>. If, however, the birds rely on a fixed cue such as increasing day length to begin flying north, they may be unable to adjust the timing of their migration. Precisely this disruption in the emergence of insects relative to the timing of songbird migration has been identified as the cause of a significant decline in populations of pied flycatchers in the Netherlands.

The primary **function** of the highlighted sentence is to

A. refute the legitimacy of an earlier claim.

B. hypothesize about a response to a particular situation.

C. point out a distinction between two theories.

D. present an explanation for a shifting environment.

E. illustrate a problem by providing an example.

- **concede** 的两种用法：[1] 承认（让步）；[2] 认可（非让步）。（注意 concession 的含义）
- **qualify** 的两种用法：[1] 限定（让步）；[2] 使合格。

作用题之“让步”类例题

An influential early view held that ecosystems contain niches for a limited number of species and that competition for resources among species—whether native or nonnative invading ones—determines ecosystems’ species composition. However, factors other than competition often help explain invading species’ success. For example, the American grey squirrel, often cited as a classic example of competitively superior invading species, was introduced in England in 1876 and now thrives, while the native red squirrel population has declined. Although scientists have found gray squirrels to be more <u>efficient foragers</u> than red ones, they also note that even before the gray squirrel’s arrival, Britain’s red squirrel populations had a periodic tendency to die out, only to be subsequently reintroduced. Furthermore, many gray squirrels are silent carriers of a disease fatal to red squirrels.

It can be inferred that the author of the passage mentions the efficiency with which gray squirrels forage primarily in order to

A. identify a factor that explains a certain phenomenon

B. call attention to an inconsistency in a particular theory

C. suggest that competition cannot be the factor responsible for a particular outcome

D. acknowledge a fact that appears to support a view that the author intends to qualify

E. cite evidence that is not consistent with an early influential view about species competition

解析：选 D。

第二篇
 
Ralph Ellison was passionately interested in visual arts. He immersed himself in Harlem’s art scene in the 1930s, even <u>apprenticing</u> with sculptor Richmond Barthe for a time. Yet he was wary of projects aiming to provide a visual rendering of his novel Invisible Man. He reluctantly allowed Franklin Library to publish two illustrated versions of the novel but found the results disappointing and repeatedly rejected proposed film versions of the book. Despite his involvement in visual arts, Ellison insisted that only language could capture the complexity of American identity. This complexity consisted of the tension arising from the collision of the United States’ written ideals, as outlined in the founding documents, and the historical and contemporary experience molding the national consciousness.

It can be inferred that the author mentions Ellison’s apprenticeship with Richmond Barthe primarily in order to

A. show that Ellison drew upon some aspects of the visual arts in developing his ideas for Invisible Man

B. show that Ellison’s claim for the superiority of the language drive from his experience with other are forms

C. establish that Ellison had experience with an art form that interested many leading figures of the 1930s Harlem art scene

D. suggest that in the 1930s the Harlem art scene provided an environment in which artists were likely to work in several media

E. qualify Ellison’s reservations about visual renderings of his work by showing that he was not indifferent to visual art

解析：选 E，reservations 这里表矜持。

作用题之“对比及反驳”类例题：第一篇

Although the passenger pigeons, now extinct, were abundant in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America, archaeological studies at twelfth-century Cahokian sites in the present day United States examined household food trash and found that traces of passenger pigeon were quite rare. Given that the sites were close to a huge passenger pigeon roost documented by John James Audubon in the nineteenth century and that Cahokians consumed almost every other animal protein source available, the archaeologists conducting the studies concluded the passenger pigeon population had once been very limited before increasing dramatically in post-Columbian America. **Other archaeologists have criticized** those conclusions on the grounds that passenger pigeon bones would not be likely to be preserved. **But** all the archaeological projects found plenty of bird bones and even <u>tiny bones from fish</u>.

The author of the passage mentions “tiny bones from fish” primarily in order to

A. explain why traces of passenger pigeon are rare at Cahokian sites

B. support a claim about the wide variety of animal proteins in the Cahokian diet

C. provide evidence that confirms a theory about the extinction of the passenger pigeon

D. cast doubt on the conclusion reached by the archaeologists who conducted the studies discussed in the passage

E. counter an objection to an interpretation of the data obtained from Cahokian sites

解析：选 E。

作用题之“解释”类例题：第一篇
 
Benjamin Franklin is portrayed in American history as the quintessential self-made man. In “Self- reliance”, Emerson asks, “Where is the master who could have instructed Franklin...?” In fact, Franklin took instruction widely, and his scientific work was highly collaborative. Friends in England sent equipment needed for his electrical experiments, others, in Philadelphia, helped him set up his workshop there. Philip Syng constructed a device for generating electrical charges, while Tomas Hopkinson demonstrated the potential of pointed conductors. Franklin, in addition to being the group’s theoretician, wrote and published its results. <u>His fame as an individual researcher is partly a consequence of the shorthand by which when one person writes about a group’s discoveries, history sometimes grants singular credit for collective effort</u>.

Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence?

A. It states a viewpoint about Franklin with which the author disagrees.

B. It introduces new evidence about Franklin’s role in the collaborative process.

C. It explains Franklin’s reputation in terms of a broad scholarly phenomenon.

D. It emphasizes the extent to which Franklin relied on others in his workshop.

E. It describes Franklin’s approach to writing scientific results.

When Earth formed 4.6 billion years ago, the Sun burned only 70 percent as brightly as it does today. Yet Geologic record contains no evidence for widespread glaciation until 2.3 billion years ago. Sagan and Mullen suggested in the 1970s that ammonia, a greenhouse gas, warmed early Earth’s atmosphere, but subsequent research showed that the Sun’s ultraviolet rays rapidly destroy ammonia in an oxygen-free environment, such as that of early Earth.

Many scientists now attribute much of the warming of early Earth to oxygen-intolerant microbes— methanogens—that produce the greenhouse gas methane. <u>The methanogen hypothesis could help to explain the first global ice age: 2.3 billion years ago, Ear th’s atmosphere began to fill with oxygen produced by other microbes cyanobacteria causing methanogens to decline rapidly.</u>

Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence?

A. It refutes the possibility of a connection between two events previously thought to be related

B. It describes how a hypothesis might account for the timing of a phenomenon

C. It presents evidence that casts doubt on a statement made in the first sentence of the passage
 
D. It clarifies a distinction between two related hypotheses

E. It introduces findings that challenge a dominant explanation for a particular phenomenon

解析：选 B。

第二篇

The manuscripts of the eight extant Latin tragedies identify the plays as the Marci Lucii Annei Senecae Tragoediae. Since nobody of that name is known, modern scholars believe the dramasto be the work of Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger, the well-known philosopher, orator and politician. <u>Clearly the tragedies were written during Seneca’s **lifetime**: internal references to earlier poets, most notably Ovid, indicate that the dramas cannot have been composed prior to the second decade C.E., and the plays must h ave been written by 96 C.E., when Quintilian quotes Medea, one of the tragedies</u>.

It is remarkably, however, that Seneca himself never mentions the plays, since there are certain passages in them that could be used to illustrate points of his philosophy. There are at least two possible explanations. In the early Roman Empire, playwrights were sometimes exiled or executed for line constructed as directed against the emperor; thus, Seneca’s silence may be simple prudence. But if anyone could safely attach his name to dramas, surely it would be Seneca, the emperor’s tutor. And although Herrmann offers Seneca’s modesty as an explanation, Seneca is not averse to referring to his other writings. The evidence for equating Seneca with the author of the tragedies seems circumstantial.

The author mentions Medea primarily in order to

A. give an example of a play in which references to certain authors can be used to determine when the Marci Lucii Annei Senecae Tragoediae were composed

B. acknowledge the possibility that the Marci Lucii Annei Senecae Tragoediae may have been written by Quintilian rather than Seneca

C. suggest that certain of the Marci Lucii Annei Senecae Tragoediae may have been written near the end of Seneca’s lifetime

D. argue that Marci may have been one of the last of the eight plays in the Marci Lucii Annei Senecae Tragoediae to be written

E. indicate how the latest possible date for the time period during which the Marci Lucii Annei Senecae Tragordiae were composed might be established

解析：选 E。

作用题之“强调”类例题：第一篇

In 1755 British writer Samuel Johnson published an acerbic letter to Lord Chesterfield rebuking his patron for neglect and declining further support. Johnson’s rejection of his patron’s belated assistance has often been identified as a key moment in the history of publishing, marking the end of the culture of patronage. However, patronage had been in decline for 50 years, yet would survive, in attenuated form, for another 50. <u>Indeed, Johnson was in 1762 awarded a pension by the Crown a subtle form of sponsorship, tantamount to state patronage</u>. The importance of Johnson’s letter is not so much historical as emotional; it would become a touchstone for all who repudiated patrons and for all who embraced the laws of the marketplace.

The author of the passage mentions Johnson’s 1762 pension award in order to
 
A. reveal that Johnson remained consistent in his rebuke of Lord Chesterfield well after 1755

B. provide evidence for a general trend in the latter half of the eighteenth century of private patronage’s

being replaced by state sponsorship

C. situate the debate over the end of patronage within the wider realm of eighteenth-century economic history

D. suggest that Johnson’s letter to Chesterfield was noticed by the Crown only years after it was
published

E. emphasize that patronage still helped support Johnson’s writing after his letter to Chesterfield

Elizabeth Bishop’s Complete Poems (1927-1979) has come to seem to most of its readers so achieved and sufficient as a life’s work that it is hard not to lose sight of how slowly Bishop wrote poems and of how few poems, finally, she completed. But Bishop herself never ceased to find her productivity inadequate. The size and pace of her output were always in her eyes a failing (vaguely moral in <u>complexion</u>) for which she apologized throughout her career, although, as I will argue in this essay, Bishop’s inability to write more poems than she did was also a refusal to do so. The small, manageable size of Bishop’s body of work has facilitated its extraordinary critical reception since her death. (Robert Lowell, whose oeuvre is so much larger, has never had a complete edition of his poetry published.) Yet the size of her work is also a sign of Bishop’s alienation, that is, her uneasy, resistant relation to the literary culture that today claims her as the major poet of her generation.

公式化：如果 - A 可以削弱 B，那么 A 就是 B 的前提条件。

前提条件题例题：第一篇

🔺In the shallow end of Lake Tomwa, there are remains of numerous Jeffery pine trees that grew there during a lengthy drought. Researchers had believed that this drought lasted at least 150 years, but carbon dating reveals that pines were growing in the lake bed for only 120 years, from 1200 until 1320. Since the Jeffrey pines, which cannot survive in water, must have died at the end of the drought, the dating shows that the drought lasted less than 150 years.

The argument given relies on which of the following as an assumption?

A. No other species of tree started growing in the bed of Lake Tomwa after 1200.

B. No tree remains of any kind are present at the bottom of deeper parts of Lake Tomwa.

C. There was at least one tree in the lake bed that was alive for the entire period from 1200 to 1320.

D. There has not been a more recent drought that caused a drying up of the shallow end of the lake.
 
E. The shallow end of the lake had been dry for less than 30 years by the time Jeffrey pines started growing in the lake bed.

解析：选 E，取反之后 > 30 + 120 > 150，因此结论不成立。

第二篇

Biologists studying wild monkeys sometimes need the genetic material DNA from a particular monkey to determine the animal’s parentage. Until recently, DNA could be extracted only from blood. Collecting a blood sample required tranquilizing the donor animal. Now DNA can be extracted from hair. Monkeys shed large quantities of hair in places where they sleep.

Therefore, researchers will now be able to determine the parentage of individual monkeys from DNA without tranquilizing the monkeys.

Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?

A. The places in which monkeys sleep are easily accessible to researchers.

B. Information about a particular monkey’s parentage is the only kind of information that can be determined from DNA that has been extracted from that monkey’s hair.

C. For at least some samples of hair collected from monkey habitat it will be possible to associate hairs with the individual monkeys from which they came.

D. Examining DNA is the only way to determine the parentage of wild monkeys.

E. It will be necessary to obtain any hair samples used in determining a monkey’s parentage from a place where the monkey has slept.

解析：选 C。

### 3.2 逻辑加强/削弱题

**题干问法**：下面的选项都是正确的话，哪个选项可以加强原文的结论，或哪个选项可以削弱原文的结论？（Which of the following, if true, most strengthen/weaken the argument given?）

**加强削弱题的核心思路**：找“**漏洞**”

- 如果是削弱题：“漏洞”可以直接削弱结论；
- 如果是加强题：“补充漏洞”可以直接加强结论。

如何找到“漏洞”？唯一的方法：比对排除选项。

加强/削弱题变体一：**评估题问法及解题思路**

a. 问法：如果补充什么信息，可以让我们更好的评论论证？（Which of the following would be most useful to determine in order to evaluate the argument?）

b. 解题思路：补充“漏洞”相关信息。

加强/削弱题变体二：**补全题问法及解题思路**

a. 文章尾部会出现一个空格，问：结论成立的原因是什么？（Which of the following, if true, most logically completes the argument?）

- Spiders of the species Argiope build distinctive zig-zag patterns, called stabilimenta, into their webs. Recent research has established that Argiope spiders use stabilimenta to collect drinking water. This discovery, far from discrediting the long-standing hypothesis that stabilimenta serve to reinforce the webs, actually supports that hypothesis since ____.
- Which of the following, if true, most logically completes the argument?

b. 解题思路：补充“漏洞”相关信息。

加强/削弱题例题：第一篇

lridium, a hard, whitish metal similar to platinum, is extremely rare on Earth. Extremely high concentrations of iridium on Earth result from only two scenarios: massive volcanic eruptions that release iridium from deep within the Earth and meteorites that shower down on Earth from space. When scientists found concentrations of iridium 30 times higher than normal in rock stratum from 65 million years ago, they concluded that a massive meteor or comet hit the Earth and caused the massive extinction of the dinosaurs.

Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the scientist’s conclusion?

A. Volcanoes massive enough to generate high concentrations of iridium are very rare.

B. Massive volcanic eruptions occurred frequently 80 million years ago.

C. Most scientists support the hypothesis that a cosmic impact wiped out the dinosaurs.

D. The massive extinction that occurred 70 million years ago killed not only the dinosaurs but also 70 percent of all life on Earth.

E. A comet struck the earth some 120 million years ago, but no widespread extinction occurred.

解析：选 A。

第二篇

The sixteenth-century art historian Vasari wrote about a building only when he himself had seen it or a detailed model of it. The thorough description of the new chapel at Larcona contained in the second edition of Vasari’s Lives of the Artists must have been contributed by someone else, since the edition was published the year before Vasari’s travels took him to Larcona, and no model of the chapel was ever shown in Florence, Vasari’s home.

Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?

A. Vasari discussed with his collaborators the new chapel at Larcona described in the second edition of the book.

B. A model of the proposed chapel at Larcona was displayed in Rome, a city Vasari visited often.

C. There were many printings of the second edition of the book, all of them textually identical.

D. Vasari did not intend to provide in his book detailed descriptions of buildings outside of his native Florence.
 
E. Most sections of the book are devoted to works of art and buildings of Vasari’s native Florence.

解析：选 B。

第三篇

🔺The pepper Capsicum chinense grows as a native wild plant only in South America. Birds swallow the pepper’s fruit whole, thereby providing the plant with its means of distributing seeds. Domesticated varieties of C. chinense grow in the Caribbean islands as well as in South America. Although it is unknown just when C. chinense was introduced into the islands, the introduction of the species was probably the result of human activity, because _____.

Which of the following most logically completes the argument?

A. the fruits of the domesticated varieties are too large for birds to swallow

B. C. chinense grows in the Caribbean islands under climatic conditions very similar to those under which the wild variety grows

C. the peppers are an important part of the Caribbean islands’ characteristic cooking

D. most of the plant species in the Caribbean islands originated is South America

E. many of the species of birds that are found in the Caribbean islands spend only the winter there

解析：选 A，注意区分家养与野生。
