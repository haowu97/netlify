## A Look Inside the TOEFL Test

The TOEFL Test allows you to demonstrate that you have the English language skills necessary for effective communication in academic setting. Here's an overview of what to expect on the test.

The TOEFL Test has four sections: **Reading, Listening, Speaking, and Writing**. All four sections are completed in one testing session, with three hours of testing time.

The first section is **Reading**.

- The Reading section has three or four passages of about 700 words each.
- For each passage, you will answer 10 multiple choice questions.
- You will have 54 to 72 minutes to complete the Reading section. During that time, you can return to previous questions to review or change your answers.

Next is the **Listening** section.

- For this section, you will wear a headset to hear the conversations and lectures.
- There are 2 or 3 conversations. Each is about 3 minutes long and has 5 multiple choice questions.
- There are 3 or 4 lectures. Each of those about 3 to 5 minutes long and has 6 multiple choice questions.
- In the Listening section, you will only hear the conversations and lectures one time. Also, you must answer the questions in the order that they are presented. In this section, you can't go back to previous questions.
- You will have 41 to 57 minutes to complete the section.

You probably noticed that **in the Reading and Listening sections, the testing time and number of questions can vary.** That is because every test includes some extra questions that are being evaluated by ETS for use in future tests and do not count toward your score.

So, your test will either have extra Reading questions or extra Listening questions, but never both. And you won't know which questions are the extra ones, so make sure you do your best on all of them.

After the Listening section, there is a required **10-minute break**. So use the time to have some water or a snack and refresh yourself for the rest of the test.

After the break is the **Speaking** section.

- The Speaking section has four tasks and takes about 17 minutes to complete.
- For each task, you will be asked a question and will be given a short time to prepare your response. Then, you will speak into the microphone on your headset for 45 to 60 seconds, depending on the question.
- Some tasks require you to listen to part of a conversation or lecture, so you will continue to use your headset. Some also require you to read a short passage.

Last is the **Writing** section.

- You will complete two writing tasks in 50 minutes by typing your responses into the computer.
- In the first task, you will read a passage and listen to a short lecture, then write your response. You will have 20 minutes to write your response.
- In the second task, you will be asked your opinion on an issue and you will have 30 minutes to write your response.

And that's it. After you finish the test, you should go do something fun. You've earned it. You did your best on an important test and that's a great accomplishment.

### How the TOEFL Test Is Scored

Each of the four sections of the test—Reading, Listening, Speaking and Writing—is scored on a scale from 0~30. The total score is the sum of the four section scores, with a range of 0~120.

You will learn more details about how each section is scored in weeks 2~5 of the course.
