**The first section is the Reading section.**

This section uses reading passages from **university-level textbooks that introduce a topic**. 

**There are 3 or 4 reading passages of about 700 words each**. For each passage, there are **10 multiple-choice questions**. You will be able to see the reading passage as you answer each question.

Most questions have four choices and a single correct answer. Some questions ask you to select two or more correct answers from a larger group of choices.

You will have **54 to 72 minutes** to complete the Reading section. During that time, you can return to previous questions to review or change your answers.

### Question types

You will learn more details about the Reading section this week through a series of videos about the different Reading question types.

- **Factual Information and Negative Factual Information questions** ask about facts, details, definitions or other information presented/ Explicitly stated by the author.
- **Inference questions** ask about ideas and arguments that are not explicitly stated in the text. **Rhetorical Purpose questions** are similar. They ask about *why* the author presents a piece of information.
- **Vocabulary questions** measure whether you know the meaning of important words in a reading passage.
- **Reference questions** look similar to Vocabulary questions. A word or phrase is highlighted in the passage, and you are asked what that word refers to.
- **Sentence Simplification questions** ask you to choose a sentence with the same meaning as a given sentence.
- For **Insert Text questions**, you are given a new sentence and asked where in the passage it would best fit. These questions require you to understand the logic of the passage and the grammatical connections between sentences.
- **Prose Summary questions** ask you to select the major ideas from a passage by distinguishing them from minor points or ideas that are not in the passage. **Fill in a Table questions** ask you to correctly categorize facts presented in the passage.

#### Factual Information and Negative Factual Information questions

*Factual Information questions* ask you to recognize information explicitly stated in the text. This information can include:

- Major ideas
- Supporting details
- Definitions

In a *Negative Factual question,* 3 out of 4 answers are correct and only one answer choice is incorrect.

*Factual Information* questions like:

1. According to the paragraph, ...
2. Paragraph X answers which of the following?

*Negative factual Information* questions like:

1. According to the paragraph which of the following is **NOT** true?
2. The author mentions all of the following **EXCEPT**

Tips:

1. Don't select an answer just because it contains words or phrases from the paragraph. Evaluate each option to determine if it is correct
2. For negative factual information questions, answer is either not in the paragraph, or it contradicts information in the paragraph

#### Inference and Rhetorical Purpose Question

An *Inference question* could ask you to identify information that is not explicitly stated. Like,

1. Which of the following can be **inferred** from paragraph 1 about X?
2. The author of the paragraph **implies** that X
3. Paragraph X **suggests** which of the following about Y?

*Rhetorical Purpose questions* ask why an author has presented a piece of information. Rhetorical Purpose Key words:

1. to illustrate
2. to explain
3. to contrast
4. to refute
5. to note
6. to support

*Tips for Rhetorical Purpose questions*:

1. **Eliminate wrong answers** if you cant identify the correct answer immediately.
2. While **some statements may be true**, but it is not the reason why the author has presented the information.

#### Vocabulary questions

*Vocabulary questions* ask you to identify the meanings of words or phrases as they are used in a reading passage.

**Word or phrase highlighted in the reading passage**. Question like,

1. The word X in the passage **is closest in meaning to**
2. The phrase X in the passage **is closest in meaning to**
3. In stating X, the author **means hat**

Words that students at university level should know. So the strategy is to **build vocabulary**.

1. *Academic Vocabulary* (EXPECTED TO KNOW): Academic vocabulary words can be used across many fields of study.
2. *Specialized Vocabulary* (DEFINED FOR YOU): Specialized vocabulary words are specific to one field. Don't need to know before.

**Only academic vocabulary words will be tested in the Reading section**.

Tips:

1. Latin and Greek roots of English words

#### Reference Questions

*Reference questions* look similar to Vocabulary questions. A word or phrase is highlighted in the passage, and you are asked what that word refers to.

- Usually the word is a *pronoun*, like "she," "they" or "it".
- It could also be a *relative pronoun*, like "which," "that" or "whom".

#### Sentence Simplification questions

*Sentence Simplification questions* ask you to identify a sentence that has essentially the same meaning as a sentence from a reading passage.

- Which of the sentences below best **expresses the essential information** in the following sentence? Incorrect choices change the meaning in Important ways or leave out essential information.

For Sentence Simplification questions, the *correct answer* choice:

- May leave out minor or unimportant details/ **Non-essential information**
- Restates the most important information/ **Essential information** in a simpler way

We need to understand the relationship between pieces of information in the sentence. Some important information like, 

- Cause/effect
- Conclusion based on evidence

*Less important information*

- Examples
- Text in parentheses
- Specific numbers or dates

#### Insert Text Questions

For *Insert Text questions*, you are given a new sentence and asked where in the passage it would best fit. 

These questions require you to understand the logical order of ideas in a reading passage and the grammatical connections between sentences.

**Every reading passage has one Insert Text Question.**

Tips: The text needed to be inserted usually include some pronouns. Really know your *pronouns* and match them to the words they refer to in a text.

- this/these
- that/those
- they/them
- him/her
- he/she/it
- which

#### Prose Summary & Fill in a table questions

The *Prose Summary questions* are designed to show that you recognize the major ideas and relative importance of information
in a reading passage.

When answering Prose Summary questions, you will need to **select the three answer choices** that express the most important ideas in the passage.

In the real test, you will **drag and drop your answers into the box**.

There are 6 answer choices, 

- 3 correct choices express the most important ideas,
- 3 incorrect choices **misrepresent information or discuss minor points**

Prose Summary questions are worth **2 points** toward raw score.

- get 2 points if you choose all 3 correct answers
- get 1 point if you choose 2 correct answers
- get zero points for 1 or no correct answers

For Prose Summary and Fill in a Table questions, your **answers do not have to be in a particular order**.

You can change your answer during the allotted time for the reading section.

In *fill in a table questions*, you will need to drag and drop you answers into two(or three) categories.

**Each reading passage will have one Prose summary question, or one Fill In A Table Question, but not both**.

Tips: take notes and create an outline when reading.
