## Overview

The second section of the *TOEFL iBT®* test is the Listening section.

This section contains two types of listening materials: *conversations and lectures*. Both are based on the actual speech that is used at universities in which English is the language of instruction. Along with accents from North America, you may hear accents from the U.K. and Australia.

The Listening section of the test contains multiple-choice tasks for which test takers must select the correct answer. This section contains **either 2 conversations and 3 lectures or 3 conversations and 4 lectures**. You will hear them only one time each.

The *conversations* are typical of those that occur on university campuses in which English is the primary language spoken. For example, there may be a conversation between a student and a professor about course requirements or the content of a lecture. There may also be a conversation between a student and a university staff member about nonacademic matters, such as registering for a class or paying for housing.

**Each conversation is about 3 minutes long and has 5 multiple-choice questions**. You will *not* be able to see the questions while you listen to the conversations. 

The *lectures* represent the kind of language used when professors teach in a classroom. The content of the lectures reflects the content that is presented in **introductory-level university courses**.

Lectures cover a broad range of subjects and topics. Here are a few examples:

- **Arts**: architecture, music history, literature, ceramics, art history
- **Life Science**: botany, animal behavior, nutrition, aquatic organisms
- **Physical Science**: weather, astronomy, pollution, technology, geology
- **Social Science**: anthropology, business, child development, history

You will not be expected to have prior knowledge of the subject matter. The information you need to answer the questions will be contained in the lecture.

**Each lecture is about 5 minutes long and has 6 multiple-choice questions**. Just as with the conversations, you will *not* be able to see the questions while you listen to the lectures.

You will have 41 to 57 minutes to complete the Listening section. During that time, you *cannot* return to previous questions to review or change your answers. The questions must be answered in the order they are presented.

You will learn more details about the Listening section this week through a series of videos. The first video explains how to approach a listening passage. It will be followed by several other videos about the different *Listening question types*.

- **Gist-content and Gist-purpose questions** require you to understand the general topic or main idea of a conversation or lecture, or its main purpose.
- **Detail questions** require you to understand and remember significant details or facts from a conversation or lecture.
- **Function questions** ask about a speaker's intended meaning, or what a speaker hopes to accomplish.
- **Attitude questions** measure whether you understand the position a speaker is taking or a speaker's opinion about something.
- In **Organization questions**, you may be asked about the overall organization of a conversation or lecture, or about the relationship between two parts of a conversation or lecture.
- **Connecting Content questions** measure your understanding of the relationships among ideas in a conversation or lecture.
- **Inference questions** ask you to draw conclusions or predict outcomes based on the information presented in a conversation or lecture.

## Approaching Listening Passages

*Get oriented*: The image on the screen and the narrator‘s words will help you figure out what the situation

- Conversations always start with a statement that **tells who the speakers are**
- For a lecture, you will first see an image indicating the **basic subject area** of the lecture
    - In some of the lectures, *words* may be presented on the screen as if written on a chalkboard. These words will be the kinds of terms or proper names that a professor might write down for the class while giving a lecture
    - Sometimes a content visual will appear as it would if the class were looking at an *illustration* in a textbook or on a screen.

**Identify important elements**

1. First, the **main idea or purpose** of the conversation;
2. Second, **key points** that the speakers make;
3. Third the **attitudes or opinions** that the speakers express

**Interactive Lectures**

In some of the lectures, the professor is the only speaker. In others, students make comments or ask questions. In the case of these interactive lectures, you may be asked about what a student said or about a student's attitude or opinion. You may also be asked about the professor's attitude or opinion. So, it's important to listen for all of the attitudes and opinions expressed as well as for the facts and ideas presented. 

**Do Key Points Support the Main Idea?**

Sometimes the key support for the main idea is quite obvious. The professor may make a statement that is the main idea of the lecture. Then she may list two or three reasons why that statement is true, elaborating on each one. Each reason could be a supporting point that is tested in a listening lecture. 

But be careful: Not all of the key points will be *directly related* to the main point or purpose. They may be a well-developed sub-topic or an aside. 

Also, remember that often, when a *TOEFL®* speaker wants you to pay close attention to what she is going to say, she will give you a *signal*, just as she might do in a regular classroom or in any campus setting. She might say something like "**Think about this**." Speakers can also give a signal by speaking a little louder or a little slower, for emphasis. You should also assume that a detail is important if the speaker uses it as an example of something, in which case she might say **"for example" or "for instance."**

**Taking Notes**

As you practice for the *TOEFL iBT®* Listening section on your own, start out by listening twice to each practice lecture and taking notes. Your notes should be brief; don't try to write down *everything* you hear. The first time through, take notes on the main idea and key supporting points for that idea. The second time you listen, try to fill in more of the supporting details in your notes, paying attention to how the ideas connect with one another. Remember that in the real TOEFL iBT test **you will hear the lecture only once**, so you will also need to practice taking notes on lectures while listening just once. See if taking notes helps you answer the questions or not. Some test takers find that taking notes is helpful, but others find that they miss too much of the lecture while trying to take notes. Determine which approach works best for you.

**Managing Your Time**

Many test takers want to know how much time they should take to answer the questions in the Listening section of the *TOEFL®* test. **A good pace is about 30 seconds per question** (two questions per minute). You can use [free practice materials](https://www.ets.org/toefl/ibt/prepare) to time yourself and get close to that pace.

**Listening to Academic Materials**

The more listening you do in English, the easier it will be for you to follow conversations and lectures in English, including those on the TOEFL iBT test. So, listen to academic material in English as much as you can—radio and TV broadcasts, podcasts, documentaries, and audio books. If you want to improve the ease with which you can process material you hear in English, increase the amount of time you spend listening to academic material in English. 

**Listen to academic lectures in English as much as possible**.

Be sure to listen to lectures in **various subject** areas: science, social science, business, arts, literature.

Start with **short lectures** on topics you are familiar with, then build up to **longer ones** on topics that are not familiar to you.

**Keep listening, even if you miss something.**

## Gist-content and Gist-purpose questions

The gist of something is the main point or key idea.

**Gist-content and Gist-purpose questions** require you to understand the general topic or main idea of a conversation or lecture, or its main purpose.

1. Gist-content questions: identify main ideas/ topic in a conversation or lecture.
2. Gist-purpose questions:  identify the main purpose of a conversation or lecture, namely, why is this lecture/ conversation happening?

Recognizing the question type:

- Mainly about
- Mainly discussing
- Why does the student...?
- What is the main purpose...?

There will always be **either a Gist-content question or a Gist-purpose question**, but never both.

Always the **first question** after listening to the passage.

If there are *two main ideas*, you'll be asked to choose 2 of the 4 answer options, instead of just one.

## Detail Questions

*Detail questions* require you to understand and remember significant details or facts from a conversation or lecture.

Recognizing the question type:

1. According to...
2. What is...?

Only **important details** would be questioned. 

You will not be expected to memorize trivial details

- such as whether something happened in 1977 or 1978

The answer to a Detail question will always be **explicitly stated** in a conversation or lecture.

## Function questions 

*Function questions* ask you to identify **the particular meaning** of a statement in a given context. A Function question may ask you to determine what a speaker was trying to accomplish by saying a particular thing.

The *real meaning* is usually different form the *surface or literal meaning*.

Function questions can include phrases like: 

1. "What does the professor mean when he says … ?"
2. "Why does the student say … ?"

## Attitude questions

*Attitude questions* ask you to show understanding of the speaker's attitude or their feelings about something.

Attitude questions can include phrases like: 

1. What is the professor's attitude?
2. What does the student think about?
3. What can be **inferred**...?

To identify the speaker's attitude, listen for phrases like

1. "What I think..."
2. "It seems to me..."

The Attitude question will then refer to 

1. how valid the speakers' argument is? or
2. how sure of the facts the speaker Is.

A speaker’s *tone of voice* cannot help you answer an Attitude question. Is the speakers voice:

- Calm or emotional?
- Relaxed or nervous?
- Certain or confused?
- Enthusiastic or bored?

## Organization Questions

*Organization questions* ask you to show understanding of how a lecture is structured. Organization questions can include phrases like:

1. Why does the professor mention...?
2. Why does the professor discuss...?

Often about the *examples* in a lecture.

*Tips*: Listen for Signal Words like,

- Introduction
- Major ideas
- examples
- conclusion

These might be like,

- Sequence words: First, next, then, second, finally
- Time or chronology: After, at last, before, during, now, since
- Obviously, of course
- Cause and effect: Accordingly, as a result, because, for example, for instance
- In conclusion, to summarize

## Connecting Content Questions

*Connecting Content questions* measure your understanding of the relationships among ideas in a conversation or lecture. They may ask you,

1. Fill in a table or chart
2. What is the likely outcome...? 
    1. Make a prediction based on what was stated in a conversation or lecture.

This type of question will ask you to put **together information from different sentences or different parts of the conversation or lecture**.

You may be asked to identify things like

- Steps in a process
- Cause/ effect relationship
- Classification
- Make a prediction

## Inference Questions

*Inference questions* ask listeners to show an understanding of the **meaning of something not directly stated**. They use phrase like

1. What are the implications of...?
2. What does the professor **imply**...?
3. What can be **inferred**...?

## Additional Listening Materials

Practice: Take the [Free Practice Test](https://www.ets.org/toefl/ibt/prepare/free_practice_test) and when listening to a conversation or lectures, try to **predict what kinds of questions will be asked, as well as what the answers to those questions will be**. Are any of the TOEFL questions the same or similar to your questions? What about the answers? The more you practice predicting what questions will be asked, the better you will get at predicting and the better you will get at listening for important information. This will help you improve your confidence about taking the Listening section of the test, as you realize you know what to expect, and what to listen for!

If you're looking to practice more, you can use these resources to practice listening to the kinds of materials that are similar to *TOEFL®* Listening passages. The links will take you outside of the course and the UMOOCs platform.
