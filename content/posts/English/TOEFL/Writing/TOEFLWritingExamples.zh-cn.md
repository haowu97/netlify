【范文】TV programs, the foundation of a quality life, /// one form of modern media, have been valued and even trigger heated discussions over + which kind of shows people should view. Entertainment shows, in some people’s views, are more **attractive / appealing**. Contrary to these people’s opinions is my perspective that it is better to watch educational channels, due to the contributions to adults and students.

（总论点：knowledge programs – adults）What must be prioritized is that watching instructional programs, **rather than** entertainment shows, **is beneficial for** adults, **by** making it easier for them to hunt for careers and get promotion. To begin with, ( knowledge – 找工作) programs **imparting knowledge** **increase the possibilities for adults to search for jobs**. In detail, ( knowledge –? - 找工作) 【abc】【信手】from **informative** shows, adults **acquire the knowledge in their majors**, **learn interview skills** and **understand the development of various fields**, which **assists them in looking for their ideal positions**; **however**, ( 找工作x –娱乐 ) people cannot **find their careers** （尽量呼应正面解释的理解/ 加入新的理由）if they **are immersed in watching** entertainment shows, **since** they can only **have the access to information** in entertainment industries and **are distracted from** the reality // they would **allocate all the time to watching** TV // they find it tedious and boring to live. Moreover, ( knowledge - promotion) watching programs that provide knowledge will **boost adults’ competitiveness in promotion**. To be more specific, (knowledge - ? - promotion ) **during the process of** viewing educational shows, employees will **practice their interpersonal skills**, **hone their time management technique**s, and **enhance their working efficiency**, **contributing to their advancement**; **on the contrary**, ( 晋升x – 娱乐) **never will** a worker **pay much attention to** interpersonal relationships or productivity at work when they only **indulge in** relaxing programs.

What should be equally worth discussing is that **instructional** programs instead of entertaining shows will **place students as beneficiaries**, by providing them with more knowledge and **triggering their interest in learning**. **Initially**, it is by watching educational programs that students can have the access to a wide range of knowledge. In detail, from movies imparting knowledge, such as that in science, art history and astronomy, students can **accumulate information** not learned in class; however, such a wide range of knowledge cannot be accessed when students watch entertainment shows, which merely focus on information about relaxation. Moreover, after the view of educational programs, students will **demonstrate more enthusiasm in learning**. To explore it further, **never can we ignore that** informative shows present a brand new world, where the unknown world, such as outer space and cell formation, is explored, triggering students to learn more themselves; however, such a strong willingness to explore does not exist when a student only watches entertainment programs.

Adults, the major components of the society, will benefit from watching educational programs. Students, the future of the society, will reap advantages from informative shows. To conclude, only by watching instructional programs can people maximize their benefits.

【题目】Society benefits from works of great artists than from political leaders.

political leaders

1. students
   1. access education
   2. well-rounded
2. adults
   1. good jobs
   2. infrastructure

【范文】The society, the foundation of a quality life, has been valued and even triggers a heated discussion over **the influence of artists and politicians on it** / whether + 句子. Works of artists, in some people’s views, **bring many benefits to citizens**. Contrary to these people’s opinions is my perspective that governors **place people as beneficiaries**, due to the contributions to students and adults.

What must be prioritized is that political leaders, rather than artists, **exert a positive influence on** the development of students, by giving them right to receive education and providing them with a well-rounded education. To begin with, the government is able to **ensure education for students**. In detail, (政府-?-上学) the government, by issuing the policy of compulsory education, building the school, and hiring the teachers, enables each student to access education **without paying a dime**; however, (x上学-艺术家) artists cannot help students receive education since they lack **the power to enact laws** and financial abilities to fund students /// students have no opportunities to receive education under the help of artist who lack the power to enact laws and financial abilities to construct schools. Moreover, it is political leaders that **promote the quality of** education. To explain it further, (政治家-好教育) **thanks to** the funding of the government, schools can establish libraries, playgrounds and laboratories, where students can do various activities and receive a well-rounded education; **contrarily**, （好教育x – 艺术家） the quality of study will not be improved **massively** with the help of artists, due to their **limited focus** on art, such as paintings and sculptures. / well-rounded education cannot be offered by artists who can only provide galleries exhibiting paintings and sculptures.

What should be equally discussed is that governors, not artists, will **benefit** adults, **through** offering them career opportunities and establishing infrastructure. Initially, politicians **make more jobs available for** adults. In detail, （政治家-?- 工作）by **boosting the economic growth**, and organizing various career fairs, the government is capable of **generating assorted job opportunities**, such as teachers, doctors, and engineers, for adults to choose from; however, (工作x – 艺术家) such a wide range of careers cannot be offered by artists who themselves may be unemployed, **not to mention** lacking the ability to develop economy. Furthermore, infrastructure can be constructed by the government for adults. To be more specific, (政治家-基础设施) political leaders have the ability to invest in local supermarkets, advanced transportation systems and sports equipment, guaranteeing a **satisfying and gratifying** life for adults; in contrast, （基础设施x – 艺术家） will these infrastructures be built by artists who have no regular incomes and little influence on the development of society?

Students, being essential in the society, are beneficiaries of politicians. Adults, being crucial for social advancement, obtain advantages from political leaders. To conclude, only with the assistance of the government can citizens **reap the maximum benefits**.
