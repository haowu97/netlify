【题目】It is better to spend time watching TV programs from which we can learn knowledge and spend less time watching entertainment program. Do you agree or disagree?

获得知识的电影更好

1. 对大人好
   1. 帮助人们找工作
   2. 帮助他们晋升
2. 对学生好
   1. 扩大知识面
   2. 能激发他们学习、探究的兴趣

【范文】TV programs, the foundation of a quality life, /// one form of modern media, have been valued and even trigger heated discussions over + which kind of shows people should view. Entertainment shows, in some people’s views, are more **attractive / appealing**. Contrary to these people’s opinions is my perspective that it is better to watch educational channels, due to the contributions to adults and students.

（总论点：knowledge programs – adults）What must be prioritized is that watching instructional programs, **rather than** entertainment shows, **is beneficial for** adults, **by** making it easier for them to hunt for careers and get promotion. To begin with, ( knowledge – 找工作) programs **imparting knowledge** **increase the possibilities for adults to search for jobs**. In detail, ( knowledge –? - 找工作) 【abc】【信手】from **informative** shows, adults **acquire the knowledge in their majors**, **learn interview skills** and **understand the development of various fields**, which **assists them in looking for their ideal positions**; **however**, ( 找工作x –娱乐 ) people cannot **find their careers** （尽量呼应正面解释的理解/ 加入新的理由）if they **are immersed in watching** entertainment shows, **since** they can only **have the access to information** in entertainment industries and **are distracted from** the reality // they would **allocate all the time to watching** TV // they find it tedious and boring to live. Moreover, ( knowledge - promotion) watching programs that provide knowledge will **boost adults’ competitiveness in promotion**. To be more specific, (knowledge - ? - promotion ) **during the process of** viewing educational shows, employees will **practice their interpersonal skills**, **hone their time management technique**s, and **enhance their working efficiency**, **contributing to their advancement**; **on the contrary**, ( 晋升x – 娱乐) **never will** a worker **pay much attention to** interpersonal relationships or productivity at work when they only **indulge in** relaxing programs.

What should be equally worth discussing is that **instructional** programs instead of entertaining shows will **place students as beneficiaries**, by providing them with more knowledge and **triggering their interest in learning**. **Initially**, it is by watching educational programs that students can have the access to a wide range of knowledge. In detail, from movies imparting knowledge, such as that in science, art history and astronomy, students can **accumulate information** not learned in class; however, such a wide range of knowledge cannot be accessed when students watch entertainment shows, which merely focus on information about relaxation. Moreover, after the view of educational programs, students will **demonstrate more enthusiasm in learning**. To explore it further, **never can we ignore that** informative shows present a brand new world, where the unknown world, such as outer space and cell formation, is explored, triggering students to learn more themselves; however, such a strong willingness to explore does not exist when a student only watches entertainment programs.

Adults, the major components of the society, will benefit from watching educational programs. Students, the future of the society, will reap advantages from informative shows. To conclude, only by watching instructional programs can people maximize their benefits.

【题目】Society benefits from works of great artists than from political leaders.

political leaders

1. students
   1. access education
   2. well-rounded
2. adults
   1. good jobs
   2. infrastructure

【范文】The society, the foundation of a quality life, has been valued and even triggers a heated discussion over **the influence of artists and politicians on it** / whether + 句子. Works of artists, in some people’s views, **bring many benefits to citizens**. Contrary to these people’s opinions is my perspective that governors **place people as beneficiaries**, due to the contributions to students and adults.

What must be prioritized is that political leaders, rather than artists, **exert a positive influence on** the development of students, by giving them right to receive education and providing them with a well-rounded education. To begin with, the government is able to **ensure education for students**. In detail, (政府-?-上学) the government, by issuing the policy of compulsory education, building the school, and hiring the teachers, enables each student to access education **without paying a dime**; however, (x上学-艺术家) artists cannot help students receive education since they lack **the power to enact laws** and financial abilities to fund students /// students have no opportunities to receive education under the help of artist who lack the power to enact laws and financial abilities to construct schools. Moreover, it is political leaders that **promote the quality of** education. To explain it further, (政治家-好教育) **thanks to** the funding of the government, schools can establish libraries, playgrounds and laboratories, where students can do various activities and receive a well-rounded education; **contrarily**, （好教育x – 艺术家） the quality of study will not be improved **massively** with the help of artists, due to their **limited focus** on art, such as paintings and sculptures. / well-rounded education cannot be offered by artists who can only provide galleries exhibiting paintings and sculptures.

What should be equally discussed is that governors, not artists, will **benefit** adults, **through** offering them career opportunities and establishing infrastructure. Initially, politicians **make more jobs available for** adults. In detail, （政治家-?- 工作）by **boosting the economic growth**, and organizing various career fairs, the government is capable of **generating assorted job opportunities**, such as teachers, doctors, and engineers, for adults to choose from; however, (工作x – 艺术家) such a wide range of careers cannot be offered by artists who themselves may be unemployed, **not to mention** lacking the ability to develop economy. Furthermore, infrastructure can be constructed by the government for adults. To be more specific, (政治家-基础设施) political leaders have the ability to invest in local supermarkets, advanced transportation systems and sports equipment, guaranteeing a **satisfying and gratifying** life for adults; in contrast, （基础设施x – 艺术家） will these infrastructures be built by artists who have no regular incomes and little influence on the development of society?

Students, being essential in the society, are beneficiaries of politicians. Adults, being crucial for social advancement, obtain advantages from political leaders. To conclude, only with the assistance of the government can citizens **reap the maximum benefits**.

【题目】To improve health, which aspect will you change in life?

1) kinds of food to eat
2) the amount of exercise
3) the amount of stress

思路：more exercise

1. new friends
   1. relationship
   2. old friends
2. physical health
   1. x sedentary
   2. x illness

【范文】First and foremost, [自己写] doing exercise, **rather than** changing the amount of stress, will **contribute to** a strong social relationship, by **enabling people to** make new friends and maintain connection with old ones. Initially, it is **plenty of** exercise / **a large quantity of** exercise that **enlarges people’s current social circles**. Specifically, (运动-？-新朋友) the more **frequently** people go to gyms and do sports, such as practicing Yoga, running or swimming, the more friends they will **encounter and establish relationship with**, including their coach and other sports amateurs; on the contrary, people will **find it difficult to** meet new friends when they choose to do stress-relief activities, which are generally done alone. In addition, **through exercising, not only can people be exposed to new acquaintances, but also they are able to keep connected with old friends**. To be more specific, （运动-？-老朋友）during the process of doing exercise, friends can gather together and **communicate over** techniques of sports, **satisfying memories** in daily life and even problems in professional life, **leading to** / which leads to + an intimate bond with each other; in contrast, **[never / under no circumstance / how / 2自己]** **how could** people leave a good impression on their close friends when they complain, or express their negative thoughts in order to release pressure?

Health, the foundation of a quality life, has been valued and even triggers a heated discussion over the approaches of leading a wholesome lifestyle. Changing food or altering stress levels, in some people’s view, are effective approaches to maintain healthy. Contrary to these people’s opinion is my perspective that sufficient amount of exercise is a more significant determiner in one’s health.

What must be prioritized is that doing exercises, rather than changing the kind of food, is beneficial for one’s physical health, by preventing people from keeping sedentary and improving immunity systems / decreasing risks of diseases. To begin with, it is physical activities that distract people from sedentary lifestyles. In detail, never can we ignore the fact that when doing sports outdoors, including playing basketballs, jogging and practicing Yoga, people are required to move around instead of maintaining seated; on the other hand, how can people change their sedentary lifestyles by changing their diets, which can be achieved at home / which does not require them to go outdoors? Moreover, not only can doing sports prevent people from sedentary lifestyles, but also it makes them less susceptible to diseases. In detail, the more physical activities people are involved in, the higher their bone density and muscle masses + are/ will be / become, which boosts their immunity systems and prevents them from suffering from diseases; however, under no circumstances will people build their muscle and boost immunity systems, which are significant in reducing illness, when they alter their diets.

Interpersonal relationship, a crucial element in one’s health, can be improved when people do exercise. Physical health, a significant part in one’s growth, can be enhanced if they exercise regularly. To conclude, only via doing physical activities can one adopt a healthy lifestyle.

【题目】Workers would be much happier if they are doing different types of tasks during their workday than doing the same task.

思路：different tasks ---> happier

1. efficiency
   1. reduce time 
   2. reduce errors
2. relationship
   1. colleagues
   2. supervisor

The importance of work, the foundation of a quality life, has been universally recognized as more than evident, bringing to people’s attention the debate over + a satisfying working mode. Doing a single task during the workday, from some people’s viewpoints, can **increase employees’ delight**. In opposition to their opinions, my perspective is that it is enjoyable for employees to do various kinds of tasks, because of **the benefits to** efficiency and the relationship at work.

A high priority is that when dealing with different tasks in workplaces, instead of a single one, employees will **enhance their efficiency**, by **reducing time and decreasing errors**. To begin with, the more **numerous** work people **cope with**, the more time they can save. In detail, （多任务-? - 省时）due to freshness caused by distinct and new work, workers will not **allocate time to** killing their time, such as browsing posts on the social media, shopping online or playing video games, which boosts their efficiency; on the contrary, how could people **distribute all the working time to** dealing with one single task when they **experience tediousness and boredom**? In addition, only under the requirement of accomplishing **assorted** tasks can employees lower the risks of errors. Specifically, （多任务-? - 减少错误）with different projects to address, workers will undergo pressure, **set higher expectations to themselves** and **become more concentrated on work**, resulting in fewer mistakes; in contrast, never can we ignore that employees handling the same work **during their workdays** find it less **laborious** and get distracted frequently due to their **assumed expertise**, under which circumstance 【prep+which / whom引导的定从】 / so they will commit more errors.

Equally importantly, a positive relationship with colleagues and their supervisor in the work field will be established when workers **tackle assorted tasks**, instead of just one. Initially, it is during the process of doing different projects that they can make a strong bond with their coworkers. To be more specific, （多任务-同事）employees, when coping with diverse tasks, will encounter, interact with and cooperate with those from different departments and **enlarge their friend circles**; however, never will a person feel delighted if he meets and communicates only with several colleagues in his group and discuss a limited number of topics each day. Additionally, it is well-known that supervisors will **appreciate those with skills and expertise in diverse fields**. In detail, （多任务 -?- 老板）not only can **versatile** employees boost sales and maximize profits, but also they will reduce the number of workers and lower budgets for his corporation, who thus are more likely to get promoted by their boss; contrarily, with merely limited knowledge or techniques a employee will not **be valued by** his **executive**.

Efficiency, a significant factor at work / being significant, will be enhanced under the demand of assorted assignments. A close connection, an ingredient in a satisfying professional life / being important, can be built when workers are required to do different projects. To conclude, only by accomplishing different work can workers achieve a satisfying life at work.

【题目】Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Would you prefer to take courses taught by professors with whom you have already had other classes during your past years of study, or would you prefer to take courses with professors whose classes you have never taken before? Why? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

【My solution】

familiar professors

- academic performance
  - more knowledge
  - enthusiasm
- personal development
  - adaptation
  - communication

College education, the foundation of a quality life, has been valued and even triggers a heated discussion over whose class we should take, familiar or unfamiliar professors. Classes taught by professors with whom they have already had other classes, in some people's views, should work better for them. Contrary to these people's opinion is my perspective that learning in classes from professors whose classes we have never taken before is superior, because of the contribution to our academic performance and personal development.

What must be prioritized is that taking classes from unfamiliar professors, instead of familiar ones, is beneficial to students' academic learning, by offering them more knowledge and triggering their enthusiasm in learning. To begin with, it is from these new professors that students can gain a wide variety of expertise. In detail, only by learning from different professors can students obtain knowledge in different subjects, such as history, economics and science, enlarging their expertise base; however, one teacher will by no means offer them such a large quantity of knowledge. Moreover, never can we ignore the significance of different professors to students' interest in learning. To be more specific, student may get interested in the various personality, teaching methods and topics from different professors, when take their courses; in contrast, how will they **keep passionate about** studying if instructed by same teacher in all classes.

What should be equally worth discussing is that taking courses of various professors, rather than of the same professor, can promote students' personal development, by boast their ability in adaptation and communication. Initially, it's well-acknowledged that students will become more adaptive through training in different professors' courses. To explain it further, in order to get a good grades from various teachers', students have to adjust their learning strategy to different teaching methods, through which students will hone their adaptation skills; on the contrary, under no circumstances will they get such adaptation skills by just learning from one professor. In addition,

【题目】Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Visiting museums is the best way to learn about a country. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

Learning about our country, the foundation of a quality life, has been valued and even triggers a heated discussion over whether the best way to know our country is to visit museums. Going to museums, in many people's view, is the most important things to do to gain knowledge about our country. Contrary to these people's opinion is my perspective that visiting museums can't be the best way to understand our country, because visiting schools and talking with local people are apparently two better way.

What must be prioritized is that visiting schools, especially universities, is a better way to know our country, due to the contribution to help us learn more about young teenagers and up-to-date technologies of one country. Initially, only through schools can we see a country's youth. In detail, through the observation of schools, we can acquire more information about students who are the future of our country and can determine a country's development; however, by no means can we predict a country's future through visiting museums where the oldest things are presented. In addition, it well acknowledged that schools, especially universities, represent the country's most advanced technologies. Specifically, since the better a country's technologies are, the better it can success in the international competition, we could receive more information about a country by knowing about technologies in universities; in contrast, how can we study our country's most up-to-date technologies by visiting museums?

What should be equally worth discussing is that...

Visiting schools, the place full of youth and up-to-date technologies, can offer us the information about the future of our country. Communicating with residents, those who represent the country's community and culture, can help us know more about our country. To conclude, under no circumstance should visiting museums be the best way to learn our country.

The hunting purpose of the cave painting of Lascaux, one of the finest examples of prehistoric art known, is the focus of both the writer and the professor. Three evidence supporting the hunting purpose, including animal subject, human figures with animal heads, and hunting events is elaborated. The professor,  however, claims that the paintings aim to confirm a successful hunting is not convincing.

As opposed to the writer's idea that the animal subject matter can prove the painting is used for hunting, the professor states that this cannot be a firm proof. He advances the theory by saying that many kinds of animals on the paintings are not hunting by prehistoric people, such as cats, and some most hunted animal, like reindeers, are not shown on the paintings; moreover, only a small proportion of animals on the paintings are wounded by arrows and spears, indicating that these animals might have not be hunted.

The professor continues to discredit the writer's assertion that the human figures with animal heads are hunters with disguise, by examining the fact that these people might not be hunters. In detail, he points out that through the posture of human figures in the painting, they are more likely to be sleeping, instead of hunting; as far as we can see, what they ware doing is still unknown.

The professor's third argument is that the painting may be served as some magic use but not for hunting, which contradicts the writer's statement that the painting is used as magic power to ensure the success of hunting. To explore deeper, the professor contends that this painting should be more likely to work in a ceremony for their ancestor.

An apparent divide exists between the writer and the professor on the purpose of the painting.

#### Reading

The Salton Sea in California is actually a salty inland lake. The level of salt in the lake's water—what scientists call its salinity—has been increasing steadily for years because the lake's water is evaporating faster than it is being replaced by rainfall or rivers. If the trend continues, the lake's water will soon become so salty that the lake will be unable to support fish and bird populations. The lake would then become essentially a dead zone. Fortunately, there are several ways to reverse the trend that is threatening the lake's health.

One option is direct removal of salt from the lake's water in special desalination facilities. Water from the lake would be pumped into the facilities and heated. This would cause the water to evaporate into steam, while salt and other materials dissolved in the water would be left behind. The steam would then be cooled down and returned to the lake as salt-free water. Gradually, the high salt levels would be reduced and the lake’s overall health would be restored.

Another possible solution is to dilute the salt level in the lake with water from the ocean. Since water in the Pacific Ocean is 20 percent less salty than water in the lake, bringing ocean water into the lake would decrease the lake’s salinity. The ocean water could be delivered through pipelines or canals.

Yet another solution would be to control the lake's salinity by constructing walls to divide the lake into several sections. In the smaller sections, salinity would be allowed to increase. However, in the main and largest section, salinity would be reduced and controlled by, among other things, directing all the freshwater from small rivers in the area to flow into that main section of the lake.

#### Listening

Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about.

It would be great if we could stop the lake salt level from increasing and save its fish and bird populations. But the solutions you just read about aren't realistic or practical.

First, sure, taking salt out of the lake by desalination would reduce salinity, but it would present some serious problems as well. For example, as you've read, water pumped into desalination facilities evaporates and leaves behind solid materials that would dissolve in the water. Well, the solid materials that desalination facilities leave behind would pose a health risk. The materials will be mostly salt, but they would also include other types of chemicals. Some of the chemicals would be toxic, like selenium. If the wind spread selenium and other chemicals into the air and people breathe them in, that would be very dangerous to people's health.

Second, the idea of bringing ocean water into the lake, again, this would reduce salinity. But as you've read, it would require constructing pipelines or canals. The problem is that the local government may not have enough resources to pay for such major construction. The nearest shoreline of the Pacific Ocean is 100 kilometers away. Pipelines and canals are very expensive to build over such long distances.

As for the third solution, dividing the lake into sections by building a system of walls. Well, that's unlikely to work for very long. That's because the Salton Seas is located in a region that experiences frequent and sometimes intense geological activity, like earthquakes. That activity would almost certainly destroy the walls separating the different sections. So while this solution might work for a short while, the walls would likely collapse the first time there is a major earthquake. And water from the special sections with high salinity would mix back in with the low-salinity salinity from the main section.

#### Reading

Bats play a crucial role in the ecosystem of North America: a bat can eat hundreds of insects in a night，reducing the need for harmful pesticides. Unfortunately, a mysterious sickness called white nose syndrome has killed over five million North American bats in the past few years, and it could wipe out several species of bats in the next few decades. The name comes from a white fungus found on infected bats; scientists think that this fungus causes bats to interrupt their normal winter sleep. Bats that wake up cannot find food and die of starvation. Several suggestions have been made to fight white nose syndrome.

笔记：white nose syndrome bats, x

First, people should stay away from the caves where bats sleep in the winter. The fungus is harmless to humans but can easily be carried on clothes or shoes from one cave to another. Many of the caves where bats have been infected are popular tourist spots for humans，and many scientists believe that the fungus likely spreads from cave to cave by riding on people's clothes.

笔记：white nose syndrome bats, x

1. x caves : clothes, shoes

Second, we need to focus on researching a species of bat that lives in Europe that appears to be able to fight the fungus. Bats of that species have been able to stay healthy even after coming in contact with the fungus，suggesting that they have evolved resistance to the fungal infection. By studying how the European bats resist the fungus，we can learn how to help American bats.

笔记：white nose syndrome bats, x

1. x caves : clothes, shoes
2. Europe bats : resistance

Finally, some researchers have suggested heating the caves with the largest bat populations. The fungus that causes white nose syndrome is known to grow only at temperatures around 4℃ . This is the temperature of most bat caves，but if we could raise that temperature just a little bit during the winter, the fungus would not be able to spread and infect the bats.

笔记：white nose syndrome bats, x

1. x caves : clothes, shoes
2. Europe bats : resistance
3. heat caves: x spread

#### Listening

Unfortunately, the suggestions you read are unlikely to help in the fight against the white nose syndrome.

First, while humans might contribute a bit to the spread of the fungus, humans aren’t the biggest factors in spreading it. Bats travel up to a hundred miles at night in the summer. And when scientists track the spread of fungus in detail, it becomes obvious that the fungus is carried from caves to caves mainly by bats. In fact, a few caves that humans have never visited before were found to be infected. Since the fungus can travel just as well on bats, stopping people from visiting caves would not have a very large effect.

Second, the discovery of European bats species that resist the fungus is interesting, but it **is unlikely to lead to any practical help** for North America bats species. The resistance of European’s bat is probably a complex biological adaptation that evolved over a long period of time. It would probably take decades of research to really understand what causes the resistance and used the knowledge to find the cure. But we don’t have that much time. The disease is progressing so widely in the North America that some bats species might completely die out within ten years.

Finally, heating the caves might actually make the situation worse. Bats use to sleeping through the winter in the cope. As soon as you over the temperature of the bats’ winter homes, the whole *psycho* would get *thrown off*. The warmer temperature in the cave might make them think it was summer and they would be unable to sleep. Remember, the reason that fungus is deadly is that it wakes up the bats during winter and causes them to starve. Heating the cave might stop the fungus but the bats would still wake up and starve.

How to **save** bats in North America **from** being infected by white nose symptoms is the focus of the reading and listening. In the writing, three solutions, including keeping humans away from bats’ caves, studying European bats and heating caves, have been elaborated. The professor, however, claims that all the assumptions are all incorrect.

As opposed to the writer’s first idea that white nose symptoms of bats can be cured when people are prevented from getting into their caves, the professor states that bats, rather than people, carry such a fungus. He advances the theory by stating that bats often travel **a hundred miles** a night and will carry the fungus from caves to caves; even bats in caves **which**(不能用where) people have not visited are infected as well.

The professor continues to discredit the assertion of the writing that American bats can be saved by scientists, who can study how European bats evolve resistance, by examining the fact that there is not enough time to research them. To be more specific, he indicates that resistance in European bats is the result of a complex biological adaptation and thus it will take decades for researches to find the cause and the cure; however, the fungus is spreading quickly and will make several species of bats die out within ten years.

It is the professor’s third opinion that heating the caves will cause bats to starve, which contradicts the idea in the writing that fungus will be killed when caves of bats are heated. In detail, when caves are heated, bats’ psycho will be in disorder, and bats will wake up because they think it is summer, making them + unable to find food and die.

An apparent divide exists between the writer and the lecturer on the solutions of killing fungus for bats.
