总论点

分论点1：尽量短

- 解释1（正面展开+反面对比）

分论点2：尽量短

- 解释2（正面展开+反面对比）

#### P1

【总论点】**What must be prioritized is that** taking distance-learning courses, *instead of having courses in traditional classrooms*, **is beneficial to students' academic learning**, *by offering them more knowledge and triggering their enthusiasm in learning*.

【分论点1】**To begin with**, it is online education that provides students with the access to a large quantity of expertise.

- 逻辑：distance learning ---> knowledge，具体见解释1

【解释1】**In detail**, on the Internet, students can acquire a wide range of knowledge in history, art and science, enlarging their knowledge base; **in contrast**, such a large amount of knowledge cannot be obtained when they are instructed by only one teacher in concreted classrooms.

【分论点2】**Moreover**, never can we ignore the significance of distance education to students' interest in learning.

- 逻辑：distance learning ---> interest，具体见解释2

【解释2】**To explain it further**, by receiving education on the Internet, students will find it more interesting to deal with mathematical problems, do research, and write proposals; **on the other hand**, will they be passionate about these tasks when teachers always lecture in brick-and-mortar classrooms?

#### P2

【总论点】**What should be equally worth discussing is that** receiving distance education, *rather than having traditional face-to-face courses*, can promote students personal development, *by honing their interpersonal skills and cultivating their persistence*.

【分论点1】**To begin with**, it is well-acknowledged that educated on the Internet, students can practice their communication skills.

【解释1】**Specifically**, only in online learning environments will students come across people from diverse backgrounds, such as classmates, instructors and school administrators, with whom they can practice their tactics of socializing; **on the contrary**, under no circumstances will they interact with such a variety of people if they are educated in traditional classroom settings.

【分论点2】**Additionally**, when having a distance education program, students will become more determined.

【解释2】**To be more specific**, the more distance-learning courses they take on the Internet, the more distractions they will be exposed to, stimulating them to resist temptations and foster their persistence; **however**, it is impossible for them to encounter these lures in traditional classrooms.

## 4. 破题方法

### 利弊题

破题方法：论证逻辑起点对于逻辑终点的好处即可。



【Example】Compared with people who live in cities, people who live in rural areas can take better care of families.

在大城市能更好照顾家人: cities ---> families
1. Cities -> earn more money(理由说)
      1. education
      2. medical care (方面说)
2. cities-> infrastructure(理由说)
      1. Supermarkets
      2. transportation（方面说）



【Example】If your teacher says something incorrect in a class, what will you do?

1. Interrupt your teacher right away
2. keep silent,
3. correct your teacher after class

课后问老师更好: after class ---> good
1. after class ---> relationship（理由说）
      1. more communication
      2. respect（理由说）
2. after classer ---> academic performance（理由说）
      1. locate errors
      2. more knowledge（理由说）

【思路1】保护环境是最好提高健康的方法: cleaning the environment ---> improve health care
1. physical health（方面说）
    1. air quality
    2. food quality(理由说)
2. mental health（方面说）
    1. less pressure
    2. happiness（理由说）

【思路2】有其他更好的方法能提高健康

1. health education > environment(方面说)
    1. knowledge > environment
    2. exercise > environment(方面说)

	1. hospitals > environment

【写法1：原因】现在花在改善世界的时间少

1. busy（理由说）
    1. study
    2. Work（方面说）
2. incapable（理由说）
    1. no money
    2. no knowledge（方面说）

【写法2：体现】现在花在改善世界的时间多
1. improve the environment（方面说）
	1. air quality
	2. water quality（方面说）
2. improve technology
	1. majors
	2. suggestions（方面说）

### 偶遇天使题、魔鬼题

#### 天使题

题目本身包含两点：该两点可作为两个总论点，或者某段内的两个分论点

- The *personal and work-related challenges* we face now are different from those our parents and grandparents faced when they were young.
- Children should *play and study* rather than learn how to do household chores.
- People should relax with *hobbies or physical activities* that are different from what they do in work.



【Example】The opinions of celebrities, such as *entertainers and athletes*, are more important to the younger people than they are to the older people.

注：属于广义上的利弊题

名人的观点对于年轻人更重要：celebrities ---> younger people
1. opinion - students（方面说）
    1. entertainer: fashion
    2. athletes: persistence（方面说）
2. opinion - young adults
    1. entertainer: friendship
    2. athletes: value exercise（方面说）

#### 魔鬼题

题目包含从句：破题时所有思路都落在逻辑终点上

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? *To truly enjoy a vacation* (holiday), people should leave their mobile phones at home.

*In order to attract good students*, many universities spend a lot of money in society activities.

【Example】*To improve health*, which aspect will you change in life? 1) kinds of food to eat 2) the amount of exercise 3) the amount of stress (15. 12. 20)

【思路1】多运动 ---> health
1. physical health（方面说）
      1. muscle
      2. eyestrain(理由说)
2. mental health
      1. X worries
      2. happiness（理由说）

## 5. 题型写法

### 反面对比法

AB题：认为A重要，对比B

ABC题：认为A重要，第个理由段段对比B；第二个理由段对比C

A题：

- 认为A重要，对比 -A
- 认为BC（自己新建的选项）重要，对比A



核心原则：

- 让题目的key words均匀分散在文章中，特别是自己选项，要不断出现。
- 尤其是自己的选项要不断出现

题目关键词：**删除法**（删除后对题意影响很大）
1. A or B
      1. Compared with people who live in *cities*, people who live in *rural areas* can *take better care of families*
2. A or B or C
      1. If your teacher says something incorrect in a class, what will you do? 1) *Interrupt* your teacher *right away* 2) keep *silent*; 3 )correct your *teacher after class*
3. A
      1. The best way for the *government* to improve *health care* is *cleaning the environment*
