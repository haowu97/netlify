综合写作本质：

- In an academic course, a student might be asked to compare and contrast *the points of view expressed by the professor in class* with those *expressed by an author in the assigned reading material*. The student must successfully **draw information from each source to explain the contrast.**

**对比感**(专名、意思<逻辑>)

## 笔记概述

笔记应包括：

- 专有名词
- 意思（逻辑）

### 专有名词

**专有名词**：固定说法，很难找到同义词的名词

- 电脑、台灯、眼镜、耳朵、太阳、双语教育、家校合作、最近发展区、强化、场依存性
- 【Example】First, the *Agnostids* may have been free-swimming *predators* that hunted smaller *animals*. It is known that other types of primitive *arthropods* were strong *swimmers* and active *predators*, so it is reasonable that the *agnostids* may have lived that way as well. And while the *agnostids* were small, sometimes just six *millimeters* long, there were plenty of smaller *organisms* in the ancient *ocean* for them to prey on.
- *星云*包含了除*行星和彗星*外的几乎所有*延展型天体*。它们的主要成份是*氢*，其次是*氦*，还含有一定比例的*金属元素和非金属元素*。1990年*哈勃望远镜*升空以来的研究还发现含有*有机分子*等物质。

是否有一个专有名词的合集？没有的，那是字典。

### 意思（逻辑）

转折逻辑：however, but, although ↳

并列逻辑：and, also, moreover, in addition ＋

总分逻辑：such as, for example, one of which e.g.

因果逻辑：because, so, thus, therefore ∵ →

顺序逻辑：first, and then, when, after →



*星云*<u>包含了除</u>*行星和彗星*<u>外</u>的几乎所有*延展型天体*。它们的<u>主要</u>成份是*氢*，<u>其次</u>是*氦*，<u>还</u>含有一定比例的*金属元素和非金属元素*。1990年*哈勃望远镜*<u>升空以来</u>的研究<u>还发现</u>含有*有机分子*等物质。

### 改写方法

保留专有名词 + 逻辑改写

- 改写后：星云不包括行星和彗星，除了这两者以外，包括其他所有的延展型天体，它包含的成分根据占比的大小依次是氢、氦，以及金属元素和非金属元素。后来，通过哈勃望远镜，人们发现星云还有有机分子等成分。

【Example: TPO 33】**Carved stone balls** are a curious type of artifact found at a number of locations in Scotland. They date from the late Neolithic period, around 4,000 vears ago. They are round in shape; they were carved from several types of stone; most are about 70 mm in diameter: and many are ornamented to some degree. Archaeologists do not agree about their **purpose and meaning**, but there are several theories.

细节只记录支持TS的专有名词，即总分专名。

【Example: TPO 33】One theory is that the carved stone balls were **weapons** used in hunting or fighting. Some of the stone balls have been found with **holes** in them, and many have **grooves** on the surface. It is possible that a cord was strung through the holes or laid in the grooves around the ball. Holding the stone balls at the end of the **cord** would have allowed a person to swing it around or throw it.

笔记:

- weapons: holes, grooves, cord

【Example: TPO 33】A second theory is that the carved stone balls were used as part of a primitive system of **weights and measures**. The fact that they tre so nearly uniform in **size**-at 70 mm in **diameter**-suggests that the balls were interchangeable and represented some standard unit of measure. They could have been used as standard weights to measure quantities of grain or other food, or anything that needed to be measured by weight on a balance or scale for the purpose of trade.

笔记：

- weights and measures: size/ diameter

【Example: TPO 33】A third theory is that the carved stone balls served a **social** purpose as opposed to a practical or utilitarian one. This view is supported by the fact that many stone balls have elaborate **designs**. The elaborate carving suggests that the stones may have marked the important **social status** of their owners.

笔记：

- social: designs, status

注：出于简洁考虑，类似elaborate之类的**形容词没必要写下来**

【Example: TPO 33】First, the stone balls as hunting weapons. Common Neolithic weapons such as arrowheads and hand axes generally show signs of *wear*, so we should expect that if the stone balls had been used as weapons for hunting or fighting, they too would show signs of that use. Many of the stone balls would be cracked or have *pieces* broken off. However, the *surfaces* of the balls are generally very well preserved, showing little or no *wear* or *damage*.

笔记：

- wear
- pieces
- surface
    - x wear
    - x damage

【Example: TPO 33】Second. the carved stone balls maybe remarkably uniform in *size*, but their *masses* vary too considerably to have been used as uniform weights. This is because the stone balls were made of different types of *stone*, including sandstone, green stone and quartzite. Each type of stone has a different *density*. Some types of stone are heavier than others, just as a handful of feathers weighs less than a handful of rocks. Two balls of the same size are different *weights* depending on the type of stone they are made of. Therefore the balls could not have been used as a primitive weighing system.

笔记：

- mass
- stones
- density
- → weight

【Example: TPO 33】Third, it's unlikely that the main purpose of the balls was as some kind of social marker. <u>A couple of facts</u> are inconsistent with this theory. For one thing, while some of the balls are carved with intricate *patterns*, many others have *markings* that are extremely simple, too simple to make the balls look like *status symbols*. Furthermore, we know that in Neolithic Britain, when someone died, particularly a *high-ranking* person, they were usually buried with their *possessions*. However, none of the carved stone balls have been actually found in *tombs or graves.* That makes it unlikely that the balls were personal possessions that marked a person's status within the community.

笔记：

1. patterns
    1. ↳ markings
    2. → status symbols
2. rank
    1. possession
    2. tomb/ grave

【Example 1】As opposed to the writer's idea that carved stone balls could be hunting weapons, the professor states that they lacked signs of wear supposed to appear on weapons. She advances the theory by saying that common weapons generally show wear, for instance, having pieces broken off, but the surfaces of carved stone balls did not show wear or damage



【Example 2】The professor continues to discredit the writing's assertion that carved stone balls, uniform in sizes, could be used to weigh and measure, by examining the fact that though having the same sizes, they were different in masses, making it impossible for them to be standard weights. In detail, she points out that carved stone balls were made of different types of stones, with distinct density; consequently, they, in the uniform sizes, varied in weight and could not be adopted as weighing systems.



【Example 3】It is the professor's third argument that some balls' simple patterns and the lack of evidence as possessions indicate that they were not social status markers, which contradicts the view of the writer that they, with intricate designs, could mark their owners social status. To explore deeper, the professor contends that admittedly, some balls were carved with elaborate designs, but others had markings that were too simple for the balls to be status symbols; moreover, unlike possessions, which people with high ranks were usually buried with, carved stone balls were not found in tombs or graves, showing that they were not possessions to represent social status.

### TPO 54

#### Reading

The Salton Sea in California is actually a salty inland lake. The level of salt in the lake's water—what scientists call its salinity—has been increasing steadily for years because the lake's water is evaporating faster than it is being replaced by rainfall or rivers. If the trend continues, the lake's water will soon become so salty that the lake will be unable to support fish and bird populations. The lake would then become essentially a dead zone. Fortunately, there are several ways to reverse the trend that is threatening the lake's health.

One option is direct removal of salt from the lake's water in special desalination facilities. Water from the lake would be pumped into the facilities and heated. This would cause the water to evaporate into steam, while salt and other materials dissolved in the water would be left behind. The steam would then be cooled down and returned to the lake as salt-free water. Gradually, the high salt levels would be reduced and the lake’s overall health would be restored.

Another possible solution is to dilute the salt level in the lake with water from the ocean. Since water in the Pacific Ocean is 20 percent less salty than water in the lake, bringing ocean water into the lake would decrease the lake’s salinity. The ocean water could be delivered through pipelines or canals.

Yet another solution would be to control the lake's salinity by constructing walls to divide the lake into several sections. In the smaller sections, salinity would be allowed to increase. However, in the main and largest section, salinity would be reduced and controlled by, among other things, directing all the freshwater from small rivers in the area to flow into that main section of the lake.

#### Listening

Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about.
It would be great if we could stop the lake salt level from increasing and save its fish and bird populations. But the solutions you just read about aren't realistic or practical.

First, sure, taking salt out of the lake by desalination would reduce salinity, but it would present some serious problems as well. For example, as you've read, water pumped into desalination facilities evaporates and leaves behind solid materials that would dissolve in the water. Well, the solid materials that desalination facilities leave behind would pose a health risk. The materials will be mostly salt, but they would also include other types of chemicals. Some of the chemicals would be toxic, like selenium. If the wind spread selenium and other chemicals into the air and people breathe them in, that would be very dangerous to people's health.

Second, the idea of bringing ocean water into the lake, again, this would reduce salinity. But as you've read, it would require constructing pipelines or canals. The problem is that the local government may not have enough resources to pay for such major construction. The nearest shoreline of the Pacific Ocean is 100 kilometers away. Pipelines and canals are very expensive to build over such long distances.

As for the third solution, dividing the lake into sections by building a system of walls. Well, that's unlikely to work for very long. That's because the Salton Seas is located in a region that experiences frequent and sometimes intense geological activity, like earthquakes. That activity would almost certainly destroy the walls separating the different sections. So while this solution might work for a short while, the walls would likely collapse the first time there is a major earthquake. And water from the special sections with high salinity would mix back in with the low-salinity salinity from the main section.

【开头】Whether several methods to reduce the salinity of The Salton Sea in California, a salty inland lake, are effective is the focus of both the writer and the professor. In the writing, three approaches, including using desalination facilities, diluting its salt level with ocean water and dividing the lake into several sections with walls, have been elaborated. The professor, however, claims that these ways are not helpful/ practical.

【P1】

### 真题

#### Reading

Bats play a crucial role in the ecosystem of North America: a bat can eat hundreds of insects in a night，reducing the need for harmful pesticides. Unfortunately, a mysterious sickness called white nose syndrome has killed over five million North American bats in the past few years, and it could wipe out several species of bats in the next few decades. The name comes from a white fungus found on infected bats; scientists think that this fungus causes bats to interrupt their normal winter sleep. Bats that wake up cannot find food and die of starvation. Several suggestions have been made to fight white nose syndrome.

笔记：white nose syndrome bats, x



First, people should stay away from the caves where bats sleep in the winter. The fungus is harmless to humans but can easily be carried on clothes or shoes from one cave to another. Many of the caves where bats have been infected are popular tourist spots for humans，and many scientists believe that the fungus likely spreads from cave to cave by riding on people's clothes.



笔记：white nose syndrome bats, x

1. x caves : clothes, shoes



Second, we need to focus on researching a species of bat that lives in Europe that appears to be able to fight the fungus. Bats of that species have been able to stay healthy even after coming in contact with the fungus，suggesting that they have evolved resistance to the fungal infection. By studying how the European bats resist the fungus，we can learn how to help American bats.



笔记：white nose syndrome bats, x

1. x caves : clothes, shoes
2. Europe bats : resistance



Finally, some researchers have suggested heating the caves with the largest bat populations. The fungus that causes white nose syndrome is known to grow only at temperatures around 4℃ . This is the temperature of most bat caves，but if we could raise that temperature just a little bit during the winter, the fungus would not be able to spread and infect the bats.



笔记：white nose syndrome bats, x

1. x caves : clothes, shoes
2. Europe bats : resistance
3. heat caves: x spread

#### Listening

Unfortunately, the suggestions you read are unlikely to help in the fight against the white nose syndrome.

First, while humans might contribute a bit to the spread of the fungus, humans aren’t the biggest factors in spreading it. Bats travel up to a hundred miles at night in the summer. And when scientists track the spread of fungus in detail, it becomes obvious that the fungus is carried from caves to caves mainly by bats. In fact, a few caves that humans have never visited before were found to be infected. Since the fungus can travel just as well on bats, stopping people from visiting caves would not have a very large effect.

Second, the discovery of European bats species that resist the fungus is interesting, but it **is unlikely to lead to any practical help** for North America bats species. The resistance of European’s bat is probably a complex biological adaptation that evolved over a long period of time. It would probably take decades of research to really understand what causes the resistance and used the knowledge to find the cure. But we don’t have that much time. The disease is progressing so widely in the North America that some bats species might completely die out within ten years.

Finally, heating the caves might actually make the situation worse. Bats use to sleeping through the winter in the cope. As soon as you over the temperature of the bats’ winter homes, the whole *psycho* would get *thrown off*. The warmer temperature in the cave might make them think it was summer and they would be unable to sleep. Remember, the reason that fungus is deadly is that it wakes up the bats during winter and causes them to starve. Heating the cave might stop the fungus but the bats would still wake up and starve.

How to save bats in North America from being infected by white nose symptoms is the focus of the reading and listening. In the writing, three solutions, including keeping humans away from bats’ caves, studying European bats and heating caves, have been elaborated. The professor, however, claims that all the assumptions are all incorrect.

As opposed to the writer’s first idea that white nose symptoms of bats can be cured when people are prevented from getting into their caves, the professor states that bats, rather than people, carry such a fungus. He advances the theory by stating that bats often travel **a hundred miles** a night and will carry the fungus from caves to caves; even bats in caves **which**(不能用where) people have not visited are infected as well.

The professor continues to discredit the assertion of the writing that American bats can be saved by scientists, who can study how European bats evolve resistance, by examining the fact that there is not enough time to research them. To be more specific, he indicates that resistance in European bats is the result of a complex biological adaptation and thus it will take decades for researches to find the cause and the cure; however, the fungus is spreading quickly and will make several species of bats die out within ten years.

It is the professor’s third opinion that heating the caves will cause bats to starve, which contradicts the idea in the writing that fungus will be killed when caves of bats are heated. In detail, when caves are heated, bats’ psycho will be in disorder, and bats will wake up because they think it is summer, making them + unable to find food and die.

An apparent divide exists between the writer and the lecturer on the solutions of killing fungus for bats.
