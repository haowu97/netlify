综合写作本质：

- In an academic course, a student might be asked to compare and contrast *the points of view expressed by the professor in class* with those *expressed by an author in the assigned reading material*. The student must successfully **draw information from each source to explain the contrast.**

**对比感**(专名、意思<逻辑>)

## 笔记概述

笔记应包括：

- 专有名词
- 意思（逻辑）

### 专有名词

**专有名词**：固定说法，很难找到同义词的名词

- 电脑、台灯、眼镜、耳朵、太阳、双语教育、家校合作、最近发展区、强化、场依存性
- 【Example】First, the *Agnostids* may have been free-swimming *predators* that hunted smaller *animals*. It is known that other types of primitive *arthropods* were strong *swimmers* and active *predators*, so it is reasonable that the *agnostids* may have lived that way as well. And while the *agnostids* were small, sometimes just six *millimeters* long, there were plenty of smaller *organisms* in the ancient *ocean* for them to prey on.
- *星云*包含了除*行星和彗星*外的几乎所有*延展型天体*。它们的主要成份是*氢*，其次是*氦*，还含有一定比例的*金属元素和非金属元素*。1990年*哈勃望远镜*升空以来的研究还发现含有*有机分子*等物质。

是否有一个专有名词的合集？没有的，那是字典。

### 意思（逻辑）

转折逻辑：however, but, although ↳

并列逻辑：and, also, moreover, in addition ＋

总分逻辑：such as, for example, one of which e.g.

因果逻辑：because, so, thus, therefore ∵ →

顺序逻辑：first, and then, when, after →



*星云*<u>包含了除</u>*行星和彗星*<u>外</u>的几乎所有*延展型天体*。它们的<u>主要</u>成份是*氢*，<u>其次</u>是*氦*，<u>还</u>含有一定比例的*金属元素和非金属元素*。1990年*哈勃望远镜*<u>升空以来</u>的研究<u>还发现</u>含有*有机分子*等物质。

### 改写方法

保留专有名词 + 逻辑改写

- 改写后：星云不包括行星和彗星，除了这两者以外，包括其他所有的延展型天体，它包含的成分根据占比的大小依次是氢、氦，以及金属元素和非金属元素。后来，通过哈勃望远镜，人们发现星云还有有机分子等成分。

【Example: TPO 33】**Carved stone balls** are a curious type of artifact found at a number of locations in Scotland. They date from the late Neolithic period, around 4,000 vears ago. They are round in shape; they were carved from several types of stone; most are about 70 mm in diameter: and many are ornamented to some degree. Archaeologists do not agree about their **purpose and meaning**, but there are several theories.

笔记:

- Carved stone balls: purpose

### 中间段

笔记格式

- TS的关键词：总分专名

TS根据和全文主旨的总分逻辑确定(有小标题，即TS的关键词)

细节只记录支持TS的专有名词，即总分专名。

【Example: TPO 33】One theory is that the carved stone balls were **weapons** used in hunting or fighting. Some of the stone balls have been found with **holes** in them, and many have **grooves** on the surface. It is possible that a cord was strung through the holes or laid in the grooves around the ball. Holding the stone balls at the end of the **cord** would have allowed a person to swing it around or throw it.

笔记:

- weapons: holes, grooves, cord

【Example: TPO 33】A second theory is that the carved stone balls were used as part of a primitive system of **weights and measures**. The fact that they tre so nearly uniform in **size**-at 70 mm in **diameter**-suggests that the balls were interchangeable and represented some standard unit of measure. They could have been used as standard weights to measure quantities of grain or other food, or anything that needed to be measured by weight on a balance or scale for the purpose of trade.

笔记：

- weights and measures: size/ diameter

【Example: TPO 33】A third theory is that the carved stone balls served a **social** purpose as opposed to a practical or utilitarian one. This view is supported by the fact that many stone balls have elaborate **designs**. The elaborate carving suggests that the stones may have marked the important **social status** of their owners.

笔记：

- social: designs, status

注：出于简洁考虑，类似elaborate之类的**形容词没必要写下来**



【Example: TPO 33】阅读笔记

Carved stone balls: purpose

1. weapons: holes, grooves, cord
2. weights and measures: size/ diameter
3. social: designs, status

## 听力笔记

听，脑记意思：

- （主）对比专名
- （次）逻辑符号

### 开头段

- 记录男女(he/ she)，用于写作中的代词
- 听，脑记意思，关注主旨句

### 中间段

- 听，脑记意思，听听力是如何反驳阅读内容
- 笔，*仅记录反驳阅读的专有名词*，即**对比专名**，和**明显简单的逻辑**，一定要筛选信息
- 适当缩写，不要试图把单词都能拼写完整

【Example: TPO 33】First, the stone balls as hunting weapons. Common Neolithic weapons such as arrowheads and hand axes generally show signs of *wear*, so we should expect that if the stone balls had been used as weapons for hunting or fighting, they too would show signs of that use. Many of the stone balls would be cracked or have *pieces* broken off. However, the *surfaces* of the balls are generally very well preserved, showing little or no *wear* or *damage*.

笔记：

- wear
- pieces
- surface
    - x wear
    - x damage

【Example: TPO 33】Second. the carved stone balls maybe remarkably uniform in *size*, but their *masses* vary too considerably to have been used as uniform weights. This is because the stone balls were made of different types of *stone*, including sandstone, green stone and quartzite. Each type of stone has a different *density*. Some types of stone are heavier than others, just as a handful of feathers weighs less than a handful of rocks. Two balls of the same size are different *weights* depending on the type of stone they are made of. Therefore the balls could not have been used as a primitive weighing system.

笔记：

- mass
- stones
- density
- → weight

【Example: TPO 33】Third, it's unlikely that the main purpose of the balls was as some kind of social marker. <u>A couple of facts</u> are inconsistent with this theory. For one thing, while some of the balls are carved with intricate *patterns*, many others have *markings* that are extremely simple, too simple to make the balls look like *status symbols*. Furthermore, we know that in Neolithic Britain, when someone died, particularly a *high-ranking* person, they were usually buried with their *possessions*. However, none of the carved stone balls have been actually found in *tombs or graves.* That makes it unlikely that the balls were personal possessions that marked a person's status within the community.

笔记：

1. patterns
    1. ↳ markings
    2. → status symbols
2. rank
    1. possession
    2. tomb/ grave

主题(主语从句) is the focus of both the writer and the professor. In the writing, three 三个TS的所属类别, including A, B and C, have been elaborated. The professor, however, claims that 听力主旨.  

 

As opposed to the writer’s idea that 阅读的TS1, the professor states that 听力的TS1. She / He advances the theory by saying that 听力的细节.

 

The professor continues to discredit the writing’s assertion that 阅读的TS2, by examining the fact that 听力的TS2. In detail, she/ he points out that 听力的细节.

 

It is the professor’s third argument that 听力的TS3, which contradicts the view of the writer that 阅读的TS3. To explore deeper, the professor contends that 听力的细节.

 

An apparent divide exists between the writer and the professor on 主题（名词）.

### 行文原则

**对比意识**：仅写阅读和听力的对比内容

- 阅读的某个细节是否需要写，取决于听力是否有针对这个点反驳
- 听力的某个细节是否需要写，取決于是否反驳阅读（应该是听力时己经筛选好了）

**读者意识**：让一个没有读过阅读没有听过听力的人，看文章就能看僅

- 对于文章的主题词进行解释
- 尽可能描述得直接、清楚，哪怕字数多些

### 范文写作

#### 开头段

- 对于主题词进行解释
- including总分逻辑，后面+n/ doing、
- 时态：模板是一般现在时态，内容根据具体动作的时间判断，如果判断较难，则均和阋读保持一致

【Example】What were the functions of carved stone balls, carved from different types of stones, is the focus of both the writer and the professor. In the writing, three uses, including weapons, standard weights and social status markers, have been elaborated. The professor, however, claims that these purposes are not convincing.

#### 理由段

不要连续抄阅读5个词汇，进行词汇变化，或者句式变化

所力用自己的话说清楚，保留对比专名、逻辑关系

听力的解释用一个句子，可用and, but, or, so连词，或者使用分号断句

对比、总分逻辑

【Example 1】As opposed to the writer's idea that carved stone balls could be hunting weapons, the professor states that they lacked signs of wear supposed to appear on weapons. She advances the theory by saying that common weapons generally show wear, for instance, having pieces broken off, but the surfaces of carved stone balls did not show wear or damage



【Example 2】The professor continues to discredit the writing's assertion that carved stone balls, uniform in sizes, could be used to weigh and measure, by examining the fact that though having the same sizes, they were different in masses, making it impossible for them to be standard weights. In detail, she points out that carved stone balls were made of different types of stones, with distinct density; consequently, they, in the uniform sizes, varied in weight and could not be adopted as weighing systems.



【Example 3】It is the professor's third argument that some balls' simple patterns and the lack of evidence as possessions indicate that they were not social status markers, which contradicts the view of the writer that they, with intricate designs, could mark their owners social status. To explore deeper, the professor contends that admittedly, some balls were carved with elaborate designs, but others had markings that were too simple for the balls to be status symbols; moreover, unlike possessions, which people with high ranks were usually buried with, carved stone balls were not found in tombs or graves, showing that they were not possessions to represent social status.

#### 结尾段

【Example】An apparent divide exists between the writer and the professor on the purposes of carved stone balls.
