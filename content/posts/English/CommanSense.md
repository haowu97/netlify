ESL v.s. EFL

- ESL全称为*English as a second language* 。这种教学是一种为主要把英语看作第二语言的学习群体而提供的教学。如：印度、巴基斯坦、新加坡、马来西亚、菲律宾等国家的学习者。“因为他们过去都是殖民地，受殖民统治，很大程度上要受到英国的影响，英语成为他们国家的第二语言甚至是他们的官方语言（包天仁，2004）”。
- EFL的英文全称是*English as a foreign language*。语言对象主要为英语为非母语的群体。



It is commonly thought that **B.C. stands for “before Christ” and A.D. stands for “after death.**” This is only half correct. How could the year 1 B.C. have been “before Christ” and A.D. 1 been “after death”? B.C. does stand for “before Christ.” A.D. actually stands for the Latin phrase *anno domini*, which means “in the year of our Lord.” The B.C./A.D. dating system is not taught in the Bible. It actually was not fully implemented and accepted until several centuries after Jesus’ death.

In recent times, there has been a push to replace the B.C. and A.D. labels with **B.C.E and C.E., meaning “before common era” and “common era,” respectively**. The change is simply one of semantics—that is, AD 100 is the same as 100 CE; all that changes is the label. The advocates of the switch from BC/AD to BCE/CE say that the newer designations are better in that they are devoid of religious connotation and thus prevent offending other cultures and religions who may not see Jesus as “Lord.” The irony, of course, is that what distinguishes B.C.E from C.E. is still the life and times of Jesus Christ.
