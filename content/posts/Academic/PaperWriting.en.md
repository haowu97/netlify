1. Raise a Question: 
2. Why important：
    1. Previous literature: debate or something missing
    2. Real world: examples, statistics
3. Puzzles: 
    1. weakness of prior literature
    2. contribution of my paper
4. Hypothesis development: 
    1. story behind is important
    2. what to expect, and why?
5. Data & Sample & Methodology(What I do?)
6. Main results/findings(paragraph by paragraph)
    1. Baseline
    2. Identification
        1. IV/ Causality test
        2. Mechanisms: accept or reject
7. (Short summary): 
    1. If findings are too much, summary something important
    2. If there are not many findings, you can omit this part 
8. (Some caveats/weakness/drawback of the paper): 
    1. problem that can't be solved easily 
    2. not encouraged to include this part
9. Literature review: Two or three related fields
10. Arrange later section

Cite previous literature to simplify your thesis narrative.

### (Hypothesis development)

In most cases, we don't have hypothesis before

Literature review

- find closest literature about your topic

Hypothesis

- Baseline argument
- mechanism behind baseline: use sub-sample/ under some condition
    - In English, as much as possible mechanism
    - In Chinese, just significant mechanism

If relationship can go either way, empirical study is more important. 

### Data & Sample

Data source: describe the advantage if using non-US data

Selection procedure

Summary statistics

- mean and medium is quiet different from each others, we may need reasonable winsorization for outliers 
    - winsor: make outliers boundary value/1% or 99% percentile value (more popular than trim)
    - trim: exclude some outliers
- key variables in baseline model 

### Methodology

### Empirical Research

1. Baseline
2. Endogenous
    1. Causality
    2. Mechanisms(identification)
3. Robust test
4. extension: some close topic after main topic is clear

Heterogeneity: sub sample, eg. SOE& nonSOE

Include variables one by one

#### Mechanism vs Robust test vs Extension

Mechanism(go deeper)

- Y, X still the same, but with interaction terms or subsamples
- Triple difference

Robust test: More than just alternative variables(go deeper)

- Y or X could be different, but in support of the main idea

Extension(go wider)

- Other important issues readers may care about. (may be backfire)

### Conclusion(Discussion)

1. policy suggestion

### Language issue

Use present tense:

- Most of the time, the general present tense is used, 
- the past tense is generally a description of outdated documents.

Active vs. passive voice: Use a positive tone for the conclusions you find

This/that: specific nouns should be followed by this/that, for example:

- This suggest

- This results suggests(preferred)

Sentence fragments & run-on sentences: It’s better to write short sentences instead of long and difficult sentences.
