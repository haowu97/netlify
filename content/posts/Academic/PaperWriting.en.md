Abstract

摘要是引言的摘要

Keywords

### Introduction

待整理

引言是全文的摘要

1. Raise a Question: 
2. why important：
    1. Previous literature: debate or something missing
    2. Real world: examples, statistics
3. Puzzles(weakness of prior)
4. Hypothesis development: story behind is important
5. Data & Sample & Methodology
6. Main results/findings(paragraph by paragraph)
    1. Baseline
    2. IV/ Causality test
    3. Mechanisms
7. (Short summary): if findings are too much, summary something important
8. (some drawback of the paper): 
    1. problem that can't be solved easily 
    2. not encouraged
9. 

Literature review: Two or three related fields

### (Hypothesis development)

In most cases, we don't have hypothesis before

Literature review

- find closest literature about your topic

Hypothesis

- Baseline argument
- mechanism behind baseline: use sub-sample/ under some condition
    - In English, as much as possible mechanism
    - In Chinese, just significant mechanism

If relationship can go either way, empirical study is more important. 

### Data & Sample

Data source: describe the advantage if using non-US data

selection procedure

summary statistics

- mean and medium is quiet different from each others, we may need reasonable winsorization: outliers 
    - winsor: make outliers boundary value/1% or 99% percentile value (more popular than trim)
    - trim: exclude some outliers
- key variables in baseline model 

### Methodology

### Empirical Research

1. Baseline
2. Endogenous
    1. Causality
    2. Mechanisms(identification)
3. Robust test
4. extension: some close topic after main topic is clear

Heterogeneity: sub sample, eg. SOE& nonSOE



Mechanism vs Robust test vs Extension

Mechanism(go deeper)

- Y, X still the same, but with interaction terms or subsamples
- Triple difference

Robust test: More than just alternative variables(go deeper)

- Y or X could be different, but in support of the main idea

Extension(go wider)

- Other important issues readers may care about. (may be backfire)

### Conclusion(Discussion)

1. policy suggestion





Language issue

Use present tense

用过去式一般使

Active vs. passive vioce 对于自己发现的结论，使用肯定的语气

这那之后加名词

This suggest

This results suggests

Sentence fragments & run-on sentences(最好写短句，不要写长难句)





公司违约率：股价波动率；债券收益率；CDS spread
