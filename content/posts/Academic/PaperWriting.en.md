Title

Abstract

Keywords

### Introduction

1. Question: important question
2. Previous literature
3. Puzzles(weakness of prior)
4. In this paper, I do sth
5. Explain why do this
6. Main results(paragraph by paragraph)
    1. Baseline
    2. IV/ Causality test
    3. Mechanisms
7. (Short summary)

Literature review: Two or three related fields

### (Hypothesis development)

In most cases, we don't have hypothesis before

Literature review

- find closest literature about your topic

Hypothesis

- Baseline argument
- mechanism behind baseline: use sub-sample/ under some condition
    - In English, as much as possible mechanism
    - In Chinese, just significant mechanism

If relationship can go either way, empirical study is more important. 

### Data & Sample

Data source: describe the advantage if using non-US data

selection procedure

summary statistics

- mean and medium is quiet different from each others, we may need reasonable winsorization: outliers 
    - winsor: make outliers boundary value/1% or 99% percentile value (more popular than trim)
    - trim: exclude some outliers
- key variables in baseline model 

### Methodology

### Empirical Research

1. Baseline
2. Endogenous
    1. Causality
    2. Mechanisms(identification)
3. Robust test
4. extension: some close topic after main topic is clear

Heterogeneity: sub sample, eg. SOE& nonSOE

### Conclusion(Discussion)

1. policy suggestion
