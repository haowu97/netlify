最近看了一篇文章，觉得可以继续做一做，但是没有源代码和数据集，要是自己还原起来，很麻烦，得自己重新设计一遍。跟老师汇报的时候，老师说为什么不问作者直接要呢？发个邮件的事情啊。

基于我们看的论文一般都是英文的，所以邮件也用英文的写罢。主要突出几个点就可以了：

- 简单介绍下自己；
- 自己的研究方向是什么，看了对方的哪一篇论文，感觉很吸引自己，表现一下对这个工作的赞美；
- 委婉的问一下是否能够给提供一下数据集和源码，简单说一下意图。

Dear  Qiquan Shi :

Thank you for reading!

I am a grade 1 master  at Nanjing University , China. 

My research is focused on Intelligent Manufacturing Decision Optimization. I have recently read your paper: " Block Hankel Tensor ARIMA for Multiple Short Time Series Forecasting". You and your team did a lot of excellent related work and gave me a lot of inspiration.

I am wondering if you could kindly send me the source program, dataset and the necessary information about it.  I promise to use it only for research and it is absolutely confidential. If it is not convenient, I hope that you will not be angry for my unreasonable request.

Thank you very much for your kind consideration and I am looking forward to your early reply.
