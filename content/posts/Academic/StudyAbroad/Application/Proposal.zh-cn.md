About the Project
The COP 26 conference in Glasgow 2021 has accelerated the need to reduce the reduce the gas emissions by 2050. In order to achieve this target, there is need to invest about $275 trillion dollars and majority of this will come from the private sector. Against this backdrop companies across the world will have to finance their operations by issuing “green” financial securities i.e., the securities whose proceeds are used towards climate-friendly environmental projects. Green Bonds have been issued corporation for this purpose. They rely on Third-party to certify that the proceeds are invested in environment-friendly projects. As such they are same as usual corporate bonds but with a “green promise”. (Caramichael & Rapp, 2022). However, Wirz, (2021) and Fletcher & Oliver, (2022) raises serious concerns about “green” bonds and ESG investments. Flammer, (2021) examine the performance of companies which have issued green bonds. She finds that investors react positively to the announcements of green bonds and the post-performance of the issuing companies improve. These findings are in line with the signalling channel. The literature in this area is quite nascent and there are various avenues that can be pursued.

Venturini, (2022) presents a systematic review of literature about the impact of climate risk in the cross section of stock returns through economic, behavioural, and rational channels. One of the interesting findings is that although the pricing of climate risk is not yet fully captured in various asset classes yet using recent data it seems that different asset classes seem to be getting sensitive to climate change risk. If this is true one of the areas that could be studied is analysing equilibrium pricing of climate change risk in the cross section of stock returns from the perspective of liner factor asset pricing models. This may help us to identify a new source of systematic risk which could be related to climate-risk. (Pástor et al., 2021) study the equilibrium pricing of climate risk using a ESG factor which they call “green minus brown” portfolio using the firm’s ESG criteria and incorporate this in a two-factor asset pricing model. They find that “green” stocks have negative CAPM alphas and “brown” stocks have positive CAPM alphas. However, whether such a factor that measures climate risk demands risk premium or not after controlling for various other sources of systematic risk is yet to be studied. Consequently, we may be able to price the climate-risk in the cross-section of security returns controlling for

A second area that can be used to study the effect of climate change risk in the cross section of stock returns is to develop novel data that incorporates meteorological information such as extreme-weather events and apply extreme value theory to understand the climate change risk in stock returns. This could use the traditional event study approach to see the sensitivities of various asset classes to extreme weather patterns and estimate cumulative abnormal r and buy-hold-returns following a weather incident.

## Evaluate climate risk in financial markets and its integration with ESG investing

About the Project
Climate change can pose significant risk to the financial system and economic activity (Giglio et al., 2021). Risk related to climate change i.e. climate risk, is classified into two broad categories: physical risk and transition risk. Physical risk stems from the direct impacts of changes in climate on the economy whilst transition risk arises from the transition towards a low-carbon economy. Physical and transition climate risk materialise through multiple transmission channels such as by influencing the consumer and investor sentiment, value of financial assets and borrowing costs on carbon-intensive investment. To mitigate and adapt to climate change, climate finance has been growing rapidly in recent years by diverting public and private financing from brown projects towards environmentally sustainable projects which helps to secure the financial resources needed to address the adverse climate effects. Climate finance also plays a key role in hedging against the risk posed by changes in climate through sharing and transferring of risk.  

The United Nation Principles for Responsible Investment highlights the importance of incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into investment decision-making, thereby promoting sustainable investment. The evolving regulatory agenda has led to a shift in the investment industry and preferences of investors, which is evidenced by the embedment of ESG in the portfolio allocation and business model. Accordingly, the growing ESG awareness has profound effects on firms’ financing conditions by aligning investment with sustainability (Avramov et al., 2022). In particular, ESG investing is an effective tool for climate risk management and portfolio rebalancing as climate change forms a focal dimension of ESG considerations.

Despite the ongoing work with respect to climate finance and ESG investing, considerable challenges remain to understand the integration of climate risk and ESG and how to effectively manage climate risk. Further research is therefore needed to contribute to achieving tangible progress in mitigating climate change and creating long-term value for investors, firms and governments. The aim of this PhD project is to explore the impact and propagation of climate risk in financial markets as well as its interaction with ESG issues. Seeking to understand: 1) whether and to what extent climate risk is incorporated into ESG investing; 2) the time-varying nature and heterogeneity in exposure to climate change across firms and financial assets by virtue of the aggregate attribute of climate risk; 3) systemic risk to the financial system arising from climate change, this project invites theoretical and empirical contributions to offer insights into the relevant phenomena.

It is expected that the applicant would have a good working knowledge of statistical software such as R, Stata, Matlab or Python.
