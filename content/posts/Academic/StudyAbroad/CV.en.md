## CV (curriculum vitae) 

Most graduate students’ CVs are **two to five pages** in length.

Within each category, list items in **reverse chronological order**.

 Keep locations, dates and less important information on the **right side** of the page – the **left side** should have important details like university, degree, job title, etc.

Stick to a common font, such as **Times New Roman**, using a **font size of 10 to 12 point**.

**Margins** should be equal on all four sides, and be *¾ to 1 inch in size*.

keep  an archival CV (for your eyes only!) that lists all the details of everything you’ve done – tailor from  there.

## Does Your Cover Letter Need a Written Signature?

When distributing your cover letter online by emailing it or uploading it onto a company’s web portal, it is not necessary to hand sign your cover letter.1 Employers don’t expect to see your handwritten signature on your cover letter. You could add a scanned image of your signature to your document, but it is optional and not required.
