# 7. Corporate Governance

## The Corporate Governance Question

Why are ownership and control separated in modern corporations?

1. Risk diversification: help shareholders diversify their portfolios (purchase stock of different Corporate)
2. Expertise considerations: professional managerial expertise creates value

To understand firms’ actions, need to take into account managerial incentives.

Evidence: Managers do matter!

- Stock prices increase after announcement of election of a “star” CEO
- But also, sudden executive deaths (plane crashes or heart attacks) often accompanied by increases in firm stock prices! 
    - Largest increases for major conglomerates, whose founders built vast empires without returning much to investors.

How do managers and shareholders differ?

Shareholders want to maximize firm’s financial value while
managers have additional objectives:

1. To reduce idiosyncratic risk (to protect their non-diversifiable human capital)
2. Career concerns (i.e., take actions that benefit their professional careers)
3. To reduce effort (managers do not suffer the full consequences of effort reductions)
4. To over-invest (empire building)
5. To protect other constituencies (e.g., employees)

Manager’s age, tenure in the firm, preferences (i.e., risk aversion), and wealth affect such differences

Some examples

a) “Entrenchment”

Managers make irreversible investments to businesses in which they have particular expertise.

Resistance to replacements and takeovers

Fact: Less resistance if managers own substantial equity

b) Making negative NPV investments to minimize risk

Managerial tendency toward diversifying acquisitions that destroy
shareholder value.

c) Keeping leverage low to reduce bankruptcy risk (at the expense of possible tax savings)

High personal cost of bankruptcy for managers e.g. risk of being fired 

d) Horizon problems

Short-sighted investments by managers

Fact: CEO compensation affected by proximity to retirement

Example: Tyco-Kozlowski’s Party

- Dennis Kozlowski’s Sardinian birthday party cost Tyco an
    estimated \$1 million
- Cost to Kozlowski depended on his equity stake in the
    company
    - If he held 1% of outstanding shares, the party cost was only \$10,000 from his perspective
    - The remaining $990,000 would come from the other shareholders
- The CEO is effectively spending other people’s money.
    Clear moral hazard problem

The “Corporate Governance” question: How should non-controlling shareholders organize the firm to better align managers’ incentives?
1. External Mechanisms of Control
  - Capital Structure
  - Market for Corporate Control (Takeovers)
2. Internal Mechanisms of Control
  - Managerial Compensation Contracts
  - Board of Directors (monitoring) / 董事会
  - Concentrated Ownership (institutional investors)
3. Other Mechanisms
  - Managerial Reputation
  - Market Monitoring



Model Setup

Both principal and agent are risk-neutrality & limitied liability

Risk-neutral principal: offers incentive contract
$$
w \in \{w_R,w_0\}
$$
If $e=0$ is to be implemented, then $ w_0^*=\{0,0\} $ (with $ \bar{\mu} = 0 $)

If $e=1$ is to be implemented, then $ w_1^* = \{w_R,w_0\} $ (with $ \bar{\mu} = 0 $)
$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{w_R,w_0} &P_H w_R+(1-P_H)w_0 \\
s.t. &w_R, w_0 \geq 0 \quad (PC) \\
&P_Hw_R+(1-P_H)w_0-B \geq P_Lw_R+(1-P_L)w_0 \quad (IC)
\end{aligned}
$$


According to IC, we have
$$
\Delta (w_R-w_0) \geq B
$$
with $w_0^* = 0$, we have
$$
w_R \geq \frac{B}{\Delta P }
$$
which gives $ w_1^* = \{ \frac{B}{\Delta P },0\}$.

**Remarks:**

1. Principal wants to induce $ e = 1 $, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_H(R-\frac{B}{\Delta P}) \geq P_L R \\
\underbrace{\Delta P \cdot R-B}_{NPV(e=1)} \geq P_H\frac{ B}{\Delta P}-B=\frac{P_L B}{\Delta P} > 0
\end{aligned}
$$

otherwise $ e = 0 $, it's under effort / under investment

2. If $e = 1 $, agent gets $P_H\frac{ B}{\Delta P}-B=\frac{P_L B}{\Delta P} > 0$, which is called agent rent. 

3. Trade-off: incentives v.s. agent rent

    Traditional model: Incentives (有风险的薪水需要更高的溢价) v.s. insurance (risk averse agent)
