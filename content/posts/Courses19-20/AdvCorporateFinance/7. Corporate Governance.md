The “Corporate Governance” question: How should **non-controlling shareholders organize the firm to better align managers’ incentives**?

## Why Corporate Governance is needed？

Why are **ownership and control separated** in modern corporations?

1. Risk diversification: help shareholders diversify their portfolios (purchase stock of different Corporate)
2. Expertise considerations: professional managerial expertise creates value

To understand firms’ actions, need to take into account managerial incentives.

Evidence: **Managers do matter**!

- Stock prices increase after announcement of election of a “star” CEO
- But also, sudden executive deaths (plane crashes or heart attacks) often accompanied by increases in firm stock prices! 
    - Largest increases for major conglomerates, whose founders built vast empires without returning much to investors.

How do **managers and shareholders differ**? Shareholders want to maximize firm’s financial value while managers have additional objectives:

1. To reduce idiosyncratic risk (to protect their non-diversifiable human capital)
2. Career concerns (i.e., take actions that benefit their professional careers)
3. To reduce effort (managers do not suffer the full consequences of effort reductions)
4. To over-invest (empire building)
5. To protect other constituencies (e.g., employees)

Manager’s age, tenure in the firm, preferences (i.e., risk aversion), and wealth affect such differences

In principle, a “complete” contract could be used. A **complete contract** specifies exactly what management does in every “state of the world” and what payments are in each state.

Problems that make **complete contracting infeasible**

- Cannot anticipate all possible states
- Actions are unobservable
- Actions are unverifiable
- Investor does not know what the right action is, Management may or may not

### Management Discretion/ Agency problems

What does a manager do with control rights?

- Expropriate assets
    - Directly (stealing or lavish perks)
    - Related-party transaction
        - Transfer pricing (set up manager-owned companies and sell output to them at below market prices) e.g.  Russian oil companies
        - Selling firm’s assets to manager-controlled firm at non market price
- Excessive perquisites and salaries, eg. RJR Nabisco
- Pet projects
- Entrench themselves and stay on job too long
    - **Entrenchment**: Managers make irreversible investments to businesses in which they have particular expertise.
    - Resistance to replacements and takeovers
    - Fact: Less resistance if managers own substantial equity
- Making negative NPV investments to minimize risk: Managerial tendency toward diversifying acquisitions that destroy
    shareholder value.
- Keeping leverage low to reduce bankruptcy risk (at the expense of possible tax savings): High personal cost of bankruptcy for managers e.g. risk of being fired 
- Horizon problems
    - Short-sighted investments by managers
    - Fact: CEO compensation affected by proximity to retirement

Example: Tyco-Kozlowski’s Party

- Dennis Kozlowski’s Sardinian birthday party cost Tyco an
    estimated \$1 million
- Cost to Kozlowski depended on his equity stake in the
    company
    - If he held 1% of outstanding shares, the party cost was only \$10,000 from his perspective
    - The remaining $990,000 would come from the other shareholders
- The CEO is effectively spending other people’s money.
    Clear moral hazard problem

Consequence of these agency problems

- Investors will not put capital into firm in the first place
- So managers have incentives to set up a system to assure investors that they will get their money back:  Set up a governance system

## How to Conduct Corporate Governance?

The “Corporate Governance” question: How should **non-controlling shareholders organize the firm to better align managers’ incentives**?

- Compensation: Murphy regression (many papers), b needs to be positive & significant

$$
\Delta(\text{CEO salary + bonus})_t= a + b \times \Delta(\text{shareholder wealth})_t
$$

- Ownership: Most top managers own stakes in their companies.
    - Dollar value vs. percentage.
- Options: most CEOs ( other employees as well), call option of stock
- Managerial Labor Market
- External Mechanisms of Control
    - Capital Structure
    - Market for Corporate Control (Takeovers)
- Internal Mechanisms of Control
    - Managerial Compensation Contracts
    - Board of Directors (monitoring) / 董事会
    - Concentrated Ownership (institutional investors)
- Other Mechanisms
    - Managerial Reputation
    - Market Monitoring

**Model 1: Moral Hazard**

Both principal and agent are risk-neutrality & limited liability

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200726175040.png)

Risk-neutral principal: offers incentive contract
$$
w \in \{w_R,w_0\}
$$
If $e=0$ is to be implemented, then $ w_0^*=\{0,0\} $ (with $ \bar{\mu} = 0 $)

If $e=1$ is to be implemented, then $ w_1^* = \{w_R,w_0\} $ (with $ \bar{\mu} = 0 $)
$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{w_R,w_0} &P_H w_R+(1-P_H)w_0 \\
s.t. &w_R, w_0 \geq 0 \quad (PC) \\
&P_Hw_R+(1-P_H)w_0-B \geq P_Lw_R+(1-P_L)w_0 \quad (IC)
\end{aligned}
$$


According to IC, we have
$$
\Delta (w_R-w_0) \geq B
$$
with $w_0^* = 0$, we have
$$
w_R \geq \frac{B}{\Delta P }
$$
which gives $ w_1^* = \{ \frac{B}{\Delta P },0\}$.

**Remarks:**

1. Principal wants to induce $ e = 1 $, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_H(R-\frac{B}{\Delta P}) \geq P_L R \\
\underbrace{\Delta P \cdot R-B}_{NPV(e=1)} \geq P_H\frac{ B}{\Delta P}-B=\frac{P_L B}{\Delta P} > 0
\end{aligned}
$$

otherwise $ e = 0 $, it's under effort / under investment

2. If $e = 1 $, agent gets $P_H\frac{ B}{\Delta P}-B=\frac{P_L B}{\Delta P} > 0$, which is called agent rent. 

3. Trade-off: incentives v.s. agent rent

    Traditional model: Incentives (有风险的薪水需要更高的溢价) v.s. insurance (risk averse agent)

Remarks

- Capital     structure that maximizes the firm value should     include **senior debt with face value between** **\$25 and ​\$75**
- Note that     it is **“debt overhang” that impedes the** **manager from getting additional funds in the     bad** **state**
- Seniority of debt     creates “good” debt overhang!

Remarks

- Not surprisingly capital structure cannot fine tune the investment     policy

- - **Bank debt can help, since it is easier than public debt to renegotiate**

- Leverage most helpful in **mature industries** with stable cash flows where firms should return money back to shareholders rather than     keep investing (create “good debt overhang”)

- Debt should be avoided in industries with **good investment** **opportunities** (avoid “classic debt     overhang”)

- Consistent with **LBO** wave of the 80s (“free cash flow hypothesis”)杠杆收购提高了公司杠杆
