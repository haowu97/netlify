The “Corporate Governance” question: How should **non-controlling shareholders organize the firm to better align managers’ incentives**?

## Why Corporate Governance is needed？

Why are **ownership and control separated** in modern corporations?

1. Risk diversification: help shareholders diversify their portfolios (purchase stock of different Corporate)
2. Expertise considerations: professional managerial expertise creates value

To understand firms’ actions, need to take into account managerial incentives.

Evidence: **Managers do matter**!

- Stock prices increase after announcement of election of a “star” CEO
- But also, sudden executive deaths (plane crashes or heart attacks) often accompanied by increases in firm stock prices! 
    - Largest increases for major conglomerates, whose founders built vast empires without returning much to investors.

How do **managers and shareholders differ**? Shareholders want to maximize firm’s financial value while managers have additional objectives:

1. To reduce idiosyncratic risk (to protect their non-diversifiable human capital)
2. Career concerns (i.e., take actions that benefit their professional careers)
3. To reduce effort (managers do not suffer the full consequences of effort reductions)
4. To over-invest (empire building)
5. To protect other constituencies (e.g., employees)

Manager’s age, tenure in the firm, preferences (i.e., risk aversion), and wealth affect such differences

In principle, a “complete” contract could be used. A **complete contract** specifies exactly what management does in every “state of the world” and what payments are in each state.

Problems that make **complete contracting infeasible**

- Cannot anticipate all possible states
- Actions are unobservable
- Actions are unverifiable
- Investor does not know what the right action is, Management may or may not

### Management Discretion/ Agency problems

What does a manager do with control rights?

- Expropriate assets
    - Directly (stealing or lavish perks)
    - Related-party transaction
        - Transfer pricing (set up manager-owned companies and sell output to them at below market prices) e.g.  Russian oil companies
        - Selling firm’s assets to manager-controlled firm at non market price
- Excessive perquisites and salaries, eg. RJR Nabisco
- Pet projects
- Entrench themselves and stay on job too long
    - **Entrenchment**: Managers make irreversible investments to businesses in which they have particular expertise.
    - Resistance to replacements and takeovers
    - Fact: Less resistance if managers own substantial equity
- Making negative NPV investments to minimize risk: Managerial tendency toward diversifying acquisitions that destroy
    shareholder value.
- Keeping leverage low to reduce bankruptcy risk (at the expense of possible tax savings): High personal cost of bankruptcy for managers e.g. risk of being fired 
- Horizon problems
    - Short-sighted investments by managers
    - Fact: CEO compensation affected by proximity to retirement

Example: Tyco-Kozlowski’s Party

- Dennis Kozlowski’s Sardinian birthday party cost Tyco an
    estimated \$1 million
- Cost to Kozlowski depended on his equity stake in the
    company
    - If he held 1% of outstanding shares, the party cost was only \$10,000 from his perspective
    - The remaining $990,000 would come from the other shareholders
- The CEO is effectively spending other people’s money.
    Clear moral hazard problem

Consequence of these agency problems

- Investors will not put capital into firm in the first place
- So managers have incentives to set up a system to assure investors that they will get their money back:  Set up a governance system

Morck/Shleifer/Vishny (1988): **Ownership & Market Valuation**

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/henrywu97/FigBed/Figs/20210323204945.png)

where
$$
\text{Tobin's Q}  = \frac{\text{the market value of firm}}{\text{replacement cost of the firm}}
$$
Consider cash flow right vs. voting right, interpretation: 

- from 0%-5%, more incentive for board to perform better
- from 5%-25%: as ownership increased, some principal-agent problems occurred，such as entrenchment
- from 25% to 100%: the value of managers is highly correlated with the value of the company

Measuring the Value of Control: Dual Class Companies. Companies often have multiple classes of stock.  Often have the same dividend rights but different voting rights

- In US, shares with votes trade at a small premium (3 – 4%) to these with the same dividends but no votes
- Premium rises during control contests (Zingales, 1995)
- Premiums much higher in other countries: Israel (45%) & Italy (80%)

## How to Conduct Corporate Governance?

The “Corporate Governance” question: How should **non-controlling shareholders organize the firm to better align managers’ incentives**?

- Compensation: Murphy regression (many papers), b needs to be positive & significant

$$
\Delta(\text{CEO salary + bonus})_t= a + b \times \Delta(\text{shareholder wealth})_t
$$

- Ownership: Most top managers own stakes in their companies.
    - Dollar value vs. percentage.
- Options: most CEOs ( other employees as well), call option of stock
- Managerial Labor Market
- External Mechanisms of Control
    - Capital Structure
    - Market for Corporate Control (Takeovers)
- Internal Mechanisms of Control
    - Managerial Compensation Contracts
    - Board of Directors (monitoring) / 董事会
    - Concentrated Ownership (institutional investors)
- Other Mechanisms
    - Managerial Reputation
    - Market Monitoring

## Boards of Directors

Motivation: Why look at boards? The legal obligations of boards are many and demanding

- They bear ultimate responsibility for the actions of the corporation
- Shareholders can only control management through them
- They must make the really big decisions
    - Hiring and firing of top management, particularly the CEO
    - Assessing and deciding on major acquisitions
    - Assessing and deciding on major divestitures of assets (including up to the corporation being acquired
    - Make decisions about security issues and major financial obligations

### Directors

A member of a board is a director.

Board members be identified in the following ways:

- Insiders: An inside director of a corporation is or has served as an executive of the corporation (e.g., the CEO, the COO, etc.)
- Outsiders: An outside director of a corporation is not an employee of the corporation (other than being a director) and has no day-to-day management duties, (and has no reported conflict of interest vis-à-vis the CEO)

Interlock: When CEO of Company A serves on board of Company B and CEO of Company B serves on board of Company A

- Interlocks among rival firms almost always illegal under antitrust laws
- Certain other restrictions on interlocks

Grey (affiliated) directors: A grey director is not an employee of the corporation (other than being a director), has no day-to-day management duties, but has a reported conflict of interest vis-à-vis the CEO

- Members of founding family
- Does business with the company: such as Lawyers, Bankers, Representatives of suppliers, etc.

Truly Independent directors

- Not insiders
- Are not dependent on the CEO
    - Are not major customers or suppliers of corporation
    - Do not provide services to the corporation
        - E.g., lawyers and consultants
    - Are not in an interlock situation vis-à-vis CEO
- Have no reason to be personally loyal to CEO
    - Are not relatives
    - Are not personal friends
- Essentially no conflict of interest vis-à-vis CEO

Directors elected according to rules set forth in corporate charter under limitations imposed by applicable law and relevant exchanges. E.g., for many years NYSE stipulated one share-one vote.

Directors elected for a term of fixed length

- Norm was one year in US
- Now three-year terms more the norm (takeover defense)
- Staggered replacement: One-third of the members are replaced every year, then the replacement is completed in three years, which allows new members of the board of directors to have enough time to familiarize themselves with the company.

### Boards and Firm Performance

Weisbach (1988) estimates CEO turnover equations:
$$
\begin{aligned}
Pr(\text{CEO turnover}) &= \text{F(Performance, board composition)} \\
&= \alpha + \beta_1 \text{stk price} + \beta_2 \text{independent directors}+\beta_3 \text{stk price}\times \text{independent directors}
\end{aligned}
$$
Main finding: CEO turnover is more sensitive to performance with outsider-dominated boards than insider-dominated ones

- Pr(turnover) ranges from 1.3% to 7% per year (as function of stock return performance)  with outsider-dominated boards
- Estimates are 3.6% to 5.7% with insider-dominated ones

Some facts:

- No evidence that outsiders matter for daily running of firm
- Outsiders make board more sensitive to performance with respect to firing decision

- Firms with smaller boards outperform firms with larger boards

Now we consider whether the market for corporate control (M&A) can help improve governance. There are two ways takeovers can serve to discipline managers (Manne (1965))

- Direct effect: Market for corporate control enables efficient firms to acquire inefficient firms and replace the inefficient managers
- Indirect effect: The threat of potential takeover can discipline managers and make them more efficient 

### Free-rider problem

Introduction to free-rider problem: Monitoring keeps managers in check. The investor that monitors incurs the full cost of the monitoring, but only receives fraction of the benefit

- Monitoring creates a positive externality on other investors, and there is under-
    provision of monitoring
- It takes a large investor for private benefits to exceed costs
- Small investors free-ride on the monitoring

Can market for corporate control help overcome this free-riding problem or does it introduce additional problems?

**Model 1: Moral Hazard**

Both principal and agent are risk-neutrality & limited liability

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200726175040.png)

Risk-neutral principal: offers incentive contract
$$
w \in \{w_R,w_0\}
$$
If $e=0$ is to be implemented, then $ w_0^*=\{0,0\} $ (with $ \bar{\mu} = 0 $)

If $e=1$ is to be implemented, then $ w_1^* = \{w_R,w_0\} $ (with $ \bar{\mu} = 0 $)
$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{w_R,w_0} &P_H w_R+(1-P_H)w_0 \\
s.t. &w_R, w_0 \geq 0 \quad (PC) \\
&P_Hw_R+(1-P_H)w_0-B \geq P_Lw_R+(1-P_L)w_0 \quad (IC)
\end{aligned}
$$


According to IC, we have
$$
\Delta (w_R-w_0) \geq B
$$
with $w_0^* = 0$, we have
$$
w_R \geq \frac{B}{\Delta P }
$$
which gives $ w_1^* = \{ \frac{B}{\Delta P },0\}$.

**Remarks:**

1. Principal wants to induce $ e = 1 $, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_H(R-\frac{B}{\Delta P}) \geq P_L R \\
\underbrace{\Delta P \cdot R-B}_{NPV(e=1)} \geq P_H\frac{ B}{\Delta P}-B=\frac{P_L B}{\Delta P} > 0
\end{aligned}
$$

otherwise $ e = 0 $, it's under effort / under investment

2. If $e = 1 $, agent gets $P_H\frac{ B}{\Delta P}-B=\frac{P_L B}{\Delta P} > 0$, which is called agent rent. 

3. Trade-off: incentives v.s. agent rent

    Traditional model: Incentives (有风险的薪水需要更高的溢价) v.s. insurance (risk averse agent)

**Model 2: Moral Hazard Induce Credit Rationing**

Remarks

- Capital     structure that maximizes the firm value should     include **senior debt with face value between** **\$25 and ​\$75**
- Note that     it is **“debt overhang” that impedes the** **manager from getting additional funds in the     bad** **state**
- Seniority of debt     creates “good” debt overhang!

Remarks

- Not surprisingly capital structure cannot fine tune the investment     policy

- - **Bank debt can help, since it is easier than public debt to renegotiate**

- Leverage most helpful in **mature industries** with stable cash flows where firms should return money back to shareholders rather than     keep investing (create “good debt overhang”)

- Debt should be avoided in industries with **good investment** **opportunities** (avoid “classic debt     overhang”)

- Consistent with **LBO** wave of the 80s (“free cash flow hypothesis”)杠杆收购提高了公司杠杆
