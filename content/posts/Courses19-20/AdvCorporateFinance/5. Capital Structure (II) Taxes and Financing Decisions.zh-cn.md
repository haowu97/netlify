## 5.1 Beyond the M&M Irrelevance Results

Capital Structure and Distribution Policy Do Matter

Evidence

- Corporations spend resources on their design
- Stock prices react dramatically to financing decisions
    - On average, stock prices react positively to announcements by firms that
        - they will distribute cash to shareholders
        - they will increase their leverage
    - On average, stock prices react negatively to announcements by firms that
        - they will raise cash
        - they will decrease their leverage

## 5.2 Trade-off Theory of Capital Structure

- In choosing their leverage ratios, firms trade off tax benefits of debt against bankruptcy and financial distress costs (财务困境)
- The optimal leverage ratio depends on firm characteristics:

| Characteristic                                | Effect on Optimal Leverage | Notes                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Profitability                                 | +                          | 盈利能力强，降低破产概率/成本           |
| Non-debt tax shields (depreciation, R&D, etc) | -                          | 非债税盾多，债务的税盾价值降低          |
| Tangibility of assets                         | +                          | 有形资产变卖收入高，降低破产概率/成本   |
| Growth opportunities                          | -                          | 成长阶段现金流不稳定，增加破产概率/成本 |
| Volatility of cash flows                      | -                          | 增加破产概率/成本                       |
| Size                                          | +                          | 综合以上                                |

## 5.3 Taxes and Financing Decisions

During the next few lectures, we will examine the costs and
benefits of using debt.

Today, we focus on how **taxes affect** the use of debt as well as other financing decisions

- Corporate tax shields are one of the main benefits of using debt financing
- Tax benefits diminish with the amount of debt used
    - At low levels of debt, further borrowing generates large expected tax shield; at high leverage ratios, further borrowing generates little additional tax shields
    - As we will discuss in future lectures, the opposite is true for the costs of debt (e.g., bankruptcy costs)

In a recent survey, 45% of CEOs agree that taxes are an important determinant of capital structure choices.

Relevant features of the U.S. tax code
1. Interest and Dividends are taxed as ordinary income; Capital Gains are taxed effectively at a lower rate (can be deferred)
2. Dividends (except for corporations) are tax disadvantaged relative to share repurchases. This difference has recently been reduced.
3. Interest expense is tax deductible, dividends are not (classical tax system; in other countries imputation system).
4. Corporations find it tax-favorable to own stock in other corporations: Corporations are taxed only on 30% of the dividend received (if they own less that 20% of the firm from which the dividend is received. See page 551 in the book for details)
5. Other (non-debt) tax shields: Tax deductions for depreciation of PPE, R&D expenses, past losses carried forward

For investors, relevant cash flows are cash flows after taxes

Need to consider four dimensions

1. Corporate Taxes
2. Tax Deductible Interest Expenses
3. Personal Taxes
4. State Taxes

### 5.3.1 Corporate Taxes

**Is This Important or Negligible?**

Suppose a firm with no debt undertakes a leveraged recapitalization, i.e., issues debt worth D and buys back equity with the proceeds

Its value changes by: 
$$
 \frac{V_{L}}{V_{U}}=\frac{V_{U}+P V(\text {Tax Shield})}{V_{U}}=1+\frac{T_{c} D}{V_{U}} 
$$
Thus, if $ T_{c}=35 \% $:

- for $ \mathrm{D}=20 \% $, firm value increases by about $ 7 \% $ 
- for $ \mathrm{D}=50 \% $, it increases by about $ 17.5 \% $

Bottom line: Tax shield of debt matters, potentially quite a bit.

Caveats:

1. Not all firms face full marginal tax rate
2. Need to consider personal taxes too

Therefore including personal taxes
$$
V_{L}=V_U+g D
$$
After considering personal taxes, three scenarios are possible

- $ g>0 $ Leverage reduces taxes (and increases value)
- $ g<0 $ Leverage increases taxes (and reduces value)
- $ g=0 $ Leverage does not affect value

**Remarks:**

- Intuition: Suppose that you have \$ 1 that you can label as "interest" or "equity return" for tax purposes. You should label it debt when:

$$
 \left(1-T_{D}\right)>\left(1-T_{c}\right)\left(1-T_{E}\right) \text{ or } g>0 
$$

- How do these tax rates look like in the real world?
    - since $ T_{D} $ and $ T_{E} $ are up to 38.6%  and $ T_{C} $ is up to 35.0%
    - For most cases $ \left(1-T_{D}\right)>\left(1-T_{C}\right)\left(1-T_{E}\right), $ which implies $ g>0 $
    - See examples next

- Without considering personal taxes, value of tax shields is estimated at 10% of firm value, considering personal taxes at 7%

Relative Tax Advantage of Debt: $ \left(1-T_{D}\right)>\left(1-T_{C}\right) \times\left(1-T_{E}\right) $
