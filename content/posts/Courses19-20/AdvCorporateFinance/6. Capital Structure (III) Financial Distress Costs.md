# 6. Capital Structure (III): Financial Distress Costs

## 6.1 Financial Distress Costs

So far, we have either excluded bankruptcy or have assumed costless bankruptcy; now, we introduce bankruptcy and financial distress costs

Financial distress costs should be attributed only to the use of debt and should include costs that result from
- The event of bankruptcy
- The threat of bankruptcy

Financial distress costs should not be attributed to:

- Misfortunes due to business risk (i.e., asset side of the balance sheet)
- Ask yourself: What additional reduction in total value can be attributed to the use of debt?

### 6.1.1 Types of Financial Distress Costs

- Direct Costs (a.k.a. bankruptcy costs)
    - Related to the legal process involving the reorganization of the firm or the transfer of control to debt holders
    - Costs that arise in the event of bankruptcy

- Indirect Costs
    - Arise from the tendency of levered firms to engage in actions that are harmful to their debt holders and non-financial stakeholders
    - Two types:
        - Indirect costs related to debt holder-equity holder conflicts
        - Indirect costs related to other stakeholders

**Remarks:**

Financial Distress cost = Bankruptcy cost, in broad sense 

- direct cost
- Indirect cost

Narrowly: 

- Bankruptcy Cost = Direct cost = Direct Bankruptcy cost = Direct Financial Distress cost

- Financial Distress cost = Indirect cost = Indirect Bankruptcy cost = Indirect Financial Distress cost

### 6.1.2 How do financial distress costs affect the “pie”

Helpful distinction between direct bankruptcy cost and indirect financial distress costs: (ignore taxes)

## 6.2 Direct Costs of Bankruptcy

### 6.2.1 Types of Direct Costs

Time that management spends dealing with creditors, 

- Average time in bankruptcy proceedings around 2 years for a typical case (both in Chapters 11 and 7)
    - Bankruptcy Process: Legal Bankruptcy can occur as
        - Liquidation/ ch7 Bankruptcy: Termination of the firm as a going concern (破产清算)
        - Reorganization/ ch11 Bankruptcy: Option to keep as a going concern (重组，大部分是此种)

Legal expenses, court and advisory fees

How large are the direct costs?

- For large companies about 3.1% of total value on average
- For small firms estimated to be as large as 25-30% of total value

However, direct costs are probably not so relevant

- Percentage of already diminished firm value
- Low present value: Multiply by probability of bankruptcy and then discount

### 6.2.2 Who bears the bankruptcy costs

Seemingly debt holders (ex-post), but ultimately equity holders through default premium (ex-ante), since debt holders foresee a potential bankruptcy.

At the time of the bankruptcy, debt holders bear bankruptcy
costs. However, ultimately equity holders do so through the
default premium

- Investors are aware of possible bankruptcy, so they “price-protect” themselves when buying securities issued by the firm (债权人根据破产成本提高相应的债券价格)
- Bankruptcy costs (direct and indirect) are initially borne by equity holders as residual claimants of the firm

What are the bankruptcy costs born by equity holders?

1. Increase in the required return on debt (to compensate for bankruptcy costs)
2. Inability to obtain additional debt needed to continue operations
3. Reduction in the return on assets: NPV > 0 projects may not be undertaken

## 6.3 Debt Holder-Equity Holder Conflicts

Shareholders of a levered firm have an incentive to invest (or pass-up on investments) to increase equity value without considering the reduction in debt value.

Conflict between discounting CF to Equity Holders versus discounting Total Cash Flows.

Two main DH-EH costs

1. Debt overhang
2. Asset substitution

For this and future examples in this lecture, unless otherwise specified, **we assume for simplicity: (1) Zero risk-free rate + (2) Zero risk premium + (3) No taxes.** 

All arguments remain valid with: (1) Positive risk-free rate + (2) Positive risk premium + (3) Taxes

Then, we have $ PV = E(CF)$.

### 6.3.1 The Asset Substitution Problem

**Remarks:**

- Debt can generate an incentive for equity holders to take on excessive risk
- Equity is a call option on firm assets so “increasing volatility” may help equity holders

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200604181320.png)

- This effect only arises if debt is “sufficiently risky” and never if it is completely safe (see above two example)

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200604182243.png)

- As the next example shows, asset substitution can also generate credit rationing (inability to borrow at “any” rate/ 无论出多高的利息都借不到钱)

### 6.3.2 Debt Overhang/ 债务积压

【Definition】**Debt overhang**: tendency of equity holders to pass up positive NPV investments when the firm’s existing debt holders are expected to capture most of the benefits.

Also known as the under-investment problem.

Note that investment decision (NPV calculating) doesn't take $ C_0 $ into account (sank cost)

**Remarks:**

- Making the expense at t=1 is always a positive NPV decision
- But the initial debt financing can impede raising new capital and hence can make the firm pass up positive NPV investments
- Which security is considered to be issued at this point (t = 1) is irrelevant (i.e., **debt overhang prevents issuing both new debt and new equity**)
- Note that the original debt holders are compensated for the debt overhang problem by requiring debt to have a face value of \$110
- Notice how **the pie shrinks**:
    - Had the project been equity financed the NPV would have been (10/11)(500 – 100 – 100) + (1/11)(150 – 100 – 100) = \$268.18
    - With debt financing, due to the debt overhang problem
        (10/11)(500 – 100 – 100) + (1/11)(–100) = \$263.63

What is the source of the problem? Can it be avoided?

- Seniority of the old debt contributes to the problem. However seniority may be desirable for other reasons.
- **The problem would be solved if the original lender provided further financing** (相比于不投资可以多收回50元的利息)
    - But there may be a free-rider problem among original lenders (多个贷款人的情形)
        - If the original debt is held by a diffuse group of lenders, it can be difficult to persuade them to invest additional resources
        - Each individual lender would like to free ride on the decision of other lenders to bail out the firm

**Remarks:**

- Debt overhang gives incentives to pass up internally
    financed positive NPV projects
- Covenants to protect creditors from this kind of behavior
    are quite common (e.g., relate cash disbursements to
    earnings and restrict them when earnings are low)
- Firms in financial distress cut dividends drastically
- Bond prices react negatively when firms announce large
    increases in their dividends

### 6.3.3 Mitigation of DH-EH conflicts

Several practices and institutions can help to alleviate DH-EH conflicts

a) Chapter 11 bankruptcy

- Debtor in Possession Financing
- Allows financing to fund investments necessary for operations
- Strip covenants and seniority from existing debt

b) Reduced use of debt

- **Conflicts arise only if debt is or can become risky**
- All-equity financing eliminates the conflicts, but at the cost of losing tax shields and other benefits of debt

c) Protective covenants

- Technical default
    – Violation of covenant
- Example of covenants: (more common in non-investment grade debt)
    - Limitations in the issuance of additional debt
    - Limitations in asset sales
    - Limitations in cash payouts
    - Reporting and disclosure
    - Changes in management, control and ownership
- Covenants may also have costs: limit flexibility
- Covenants have become more stringent after the 80s
    - Sometimes restrict takeovers and leveraged recapitalizations
    - Bank debt tends to have more covenants and more stringent ones than public debt

d) Bank and Privately Placed Debt

- Solve free-rider problem
- Better monitor (perhaps better control of asset substitution)
- However more costly
- Possible hold-up problems (if firm depends on a lender, this lender would have “too much” power in future renegotiations)

e) Use of short-term debt instead of long-term debt

- Helps with Debt Overhang, Asset substitution or Reluctance to liquidate
- Can generate shortsightedness
- Increase direct costs of bankruptcy and transaction costs
    In some situations can generate “excessive” incentives to liquidate (see Massey-Ferguson case)

f) Other possibilities

- Security design (e.g., convertibles)
- Managerial compensation
