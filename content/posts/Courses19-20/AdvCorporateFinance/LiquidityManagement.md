Liquidity Management

Keynes(1936)General Theory

- If financial markets work as well as we typically assume they do, firms' liquidity decisions would be irrelevant (MM)
- If financial markets contain frictions, liquidity decisions are important

## Cash Balances Over Time

Explanations for the increase in cash

- Cash ratios increase because firms' cash flows become riskier
- In addition, firms change: They hold fewer inventories and receivables and are increasingly R\&D intensive
- Aside: Whenever there is a time trend in firms' behavior, one usually has to distinguish the hypothesis that "the nature of firms change over time" from "the behavior of a given firm changes‚Äù

**Thinking: Is the cash ratio a leading variable in the business cycle?**

Much of the cash is held abroad

With the increasing number of multinational companies, multinational companies tend to keep more cash in different countries due to **cross-border capital flow taxes**.

## Payout Versus Retention of Cash

In perfect capital markets, once a firm has taken all positive NPV investments, it is indifferent between saving excess cash and paying it out(MM (1961) Payout Irrelevance)

- If a firm has already taken all positive-NPV projects, any additional projects it takes on are zero or negative-NPV investments
- Rather than waste excess cash on negative-NPV projects, a firm can use the cash to purchase financial assets
- In perfect capital markets, buying and selling securities is a zero-NPV transaction, so it should not affect firm value
- Thus, with perfect capital markets, the retention versus payout decision is irrelevant

With market imperfections, there is a tradeoff: Retaining cash can reduce the costs of raising capital in the future, but it can also increase taxes and agency costs

### The traditional explanations for retaining cash (besides taxes)

The transaction costs motive: Keynes' (1936)

- A firm short of liquid assets has to raise funds in the capital markets, liquidate existing assets, reduce dividends and investment, renegotiate existing financial contracts, or some combination of these actions.
- The fixed costs of accessing outside markets induce the firm to raise funds infrequently, and to use cash and liquid asset holdings as a buffer.
- As a result, for a given amount of net debt, there is an optimal amount of cash, and cash is not simply negative debt.

The precautionary motive, generated form information costs in the form of:

- **Adverse selection** in financial markets: Information asymmetries make it harder to raise outside funds (Pecking order Myers and Majluf, 1984 )
- **Managerial agency costs** associated with the use of debt: High leverage firms find it difficult and expensive to raise additional funds (asset substitution/ overinvestment problem (Jensen and Meckling (1976), and underinvestment problem Myers (1977))

Agency costs of managerial discretion over the use of cash. Managers may hold cash to pursue their own objectives at shareholder expense
- Management may hold excess cash simply because it is risk averse. More entrenched management would therefore be more likely to hold excess cash because it can avoid market discipline.
- Management may accumulate cash to have more flexibility to pursue its own objectives, like in Jensen's FCF hypothesis

The financing hierarchy theory (pecking order theory)

- Interpret cash as equity (accumulated internal CF) 
- Allow for adverse selection in financial markets
- Equity is first and last as a source: internal and external 
- There is no optimal amount of cash precisely because there is no optimum level of debt

All four explanations to some extent rely on the idea that external finance is costly, because of:
- Transaction costs 
- Asymmetric information
- External Monitoring

If you account for corporate taxes as the cost of holding cash, the first three theories suggest a trade off and a target cash holdings, while the last does not.

### Do firms have target cash levels?

The first step in investigating whether firms have target cash levels is to examine whether cash holdings revert to the mean

Basic Strategy: see if cash is mean reverting

Advanced strategy: define target and see if cash changes depend on relative position with respect to target in previous year

Opler, Pinkowitz, Stulz, and Williamson (1999)

If there is an optimal cash ratio, then the beta will be close to -1.

The coefficient is larger than -1.

Imperfect adjustment might be consistent with a "pecking order theory" of cash

Alternatively, it might still be consistent with a "trade-off theory" of cash, under which firms have an optimal cash level, if firms do rebalance their cash holdings albeit infrequently, due to adjustment costs.
