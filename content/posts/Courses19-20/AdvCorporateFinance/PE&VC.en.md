Private equity is illiquid, ownership is concentrated, valuation is difficult, intermediaries tend to be small, finance is accompanied by control and mentoring.

- Private Equity: Buy-outs, Later stage financing

- Venture capital: Early stage financing

Public equity: Stock market listed companies

Public equity is liquid, ownership is dispersed, valuation is relatively easy, intermediaries are large, finance is often divorced from control and mentoring. 

## The investment cycle

There is lots of rather specialised language associated with private equity: general partners, limited partners, committed capital, draw downs, gatekeepers, carried interest, vintages, hurdle rate, co-investment, fund-of-funds, follow-on-fund …

- Limited Partner: investors, supply money to GP
- General Partner: work as Fund managers, manage money, do investment and get management fee
    - GP’s are restricted in amount of fund capital invested in each deal, rest has to be provided by other parties 
    - Rights to pick future investments

**Buy-outs are the majority**: Two-thirds of the equity raised for PE is devoted to buy-outs (in both Europe and US), but these are **highly leveraged (LBO)** – often with only 30% equity in capital structure; so the value of transactions is much larger than the equity figures suggest.

Valuations and leverage were extremely high until Summer 2007 when debt market crash lowered both prices and volume of deals.

Deals got very large: US hospitals group HCA was acquired in November 2006 for \$33 billion in a club deal by Bain Capital, KKR & Merrill Lynch PE. This was the largest ever buy-out until ….

Blackstone agreed to acquire Chicago-based office building manager Equity Office Properties Trust for $36 billion in late November 2006. This is more of a real estate deal, but shows that the big PE groups are diversifying across the range of alternative asset classes.

## How are funds structured?

Marketing: find money supply. 

Draw down/investment: find project to invest.

Realisation or returns and exit: Investments must be exited by the end of the fund’s life, typically within 8-12 years.

Extension: if the project performs well, it can extend the holding period and must exit after expiration

Responsible for enormous quantity of investment, Buyouts and Venture Deals add up to >$400 bn. in 2006.

How does a private equity deal work?

- PE fund acquires equity in a firm, funds are Limited Partnerships with finite life.
- Financing from two sources: 
    - Own fund capital
    - Third party financing
        - Banks, bonds (LBO funds)
        - Equity syndication partner (VC funds) 
- Fund holds firm for 2-10 years, then exits
    - IPO, trade sale, secondary, liquidation

## Fees and performance measures

LPs contribute capital for “pool” of future investments

GPs get: Management fee (1 – 2 %) plus ‘Carry’ (20%)

annual management fees at 2% of committed capital

- varies from 1% to 3%
- large buy-out funds are closer to 1.5%
- and fees drop after investment period

“carried interest” usually equal to 20% of profits

- profits are worked out on the basis of the entire fund; losses are netted against profits
- but if the fund produces an overall loss, PE fund does not share in the losses
- there is often a hurdle to jump, such as 8% IRR
- note that this is a hurdle – once it is jumped, then GP gets 20% of total return (e.g. if IRR = 7% GP gets zero; if IRR = 10%, GP gets 2%) 

investors normally focus on two metrics:

- IRR: the discount rate which make NPV equals to 0.
- x money – sometimes called total value to paid in (TVPI)

Example:

- LP: provide \$10B
- GP: get \$10B*2% = 0.2B
- If the final value of portfolio firm arrive at \$98B, then GP get $ 20\% \times (98B-9.8B)$, LP get $ 20\% \times (98B-9.8B)$.

## Cyclical Market

A common observation about the PE Industry: The market is incredibly cyclical

High returns--->High inflow of capital to new funds ---> Low returns ---> Low inflow of capital ---> High returns etc.

In booms/low interest environments investment discipline “too loose”

- Signs of overinvestment: Deals have worse returns

In busts/high interest environments investment discipline “too strict”:

- Signs of ”underinvestment”:
    - GPs complain that banks don’t lend even when they have good deals
    - Deals that do get made have high returns

## Implication for China issue/ Topics worth studying

- Cash reserve of SOEs vs. non-SOEs
- stock repurchase waves: Nearly half of listed companies have recovered their equity through stock repurchase, the IPO market is also shrinking.
- Investing strategies PE firms in China: foreign vs. domestic
- The engagement of PE funds in the stock market: Why some of PE participate in public stock market investment instead of private equity investment.
- Revolving credit line of Chinese listed firms: Set a debt limit, as long as it does not exceed the limit, you can continue to borrow.
- PE-backed M&As: selection or better governance?
