# 7. Auction Theory

Auction theory (FPA and SPA).

- Part of MWG Chapter 23.B

It also related to topics on “incentives and mechanism design”

- MWG Chapter 23.A – 23.D, JR Chapter 9

Auctions are a large part of the economic landscape:

- Since Babylon in 500 BC, and Rome in 193 AC
- Auction houses Shotheby‘s and Christi’s founded in 1744 and 1766.

## 7.1 Settings

One seller and $N$ bidders, each bidder $i$ with a valuation $v_i$ for the object.

### 7.1.1 Auction Mechanisms

We can design many different rules for the auction:

1. **First price auction**: the winner is the bidder submitting the
    highest bid, and he/she must pay the highest bid (which is
    his/hers).
2. **Second price auction**: the winner is the bidder submitting the highest bid, but he/she must pay the second highest bid.
3. **Third price auction**: the winner is the bidder submitting the highest bid, but he/she must pay the third highest bid.
4. **All-pay auction**: the winner is the bidder submitting the highest bid, but every single bidder must pay the price he/she submitted.
5. **Lottery auction**: bidder $i$ get the object with $prob\text {(win) }=\frac{b_i}{b_{1}+b_{2}+\ldots b_{N}}$, where $b_i$ is bidder $i$ 's  bid price.

All auctions can be interpreted as allocation mechanisms with
the following ingredients:

- **an allocation rule** (who gets the object):
    - The allocation rule for most auctions determines the object is allocated to the individual submitting the highest bid
    - However, we could assign the object by a lottery, where prob $ prob\text {(win) }=\frac{b_i}{b_{1}+b_{2}+\ldots b_{N}} $
- **a payment rule** (how much every bidder must pay):
    - The payment rule in the FPA determines that the individual submitting the highest bid pays his bid, while everybody else pays zero
    - The payment rule in the SPA determines that the individual submitting the highest bid pays the second highest bid, while everybody else pays zero.
    - The payment rule in the APA determines that every individual must pay the bid he/she submitted.
        rivate valuations.

### 7.1.2 Private Valuations

Symmetric incomplete information:

- I know my own valuation for the object, $v_{i}$.

- I don't know your valuation for the object, $v_{j}$, but I know that it is drawn from a distribution function.

Easiest case:

$$
v_j=
\begin{cases}
10&,\text{with probability 0.4, or}\\
5&, \text{with probability 0.6}
\end{cases}
$$

More generally, CDF of $ v_j $

$$
F(v)=\operatorname{prob}\left(v_{j}<v\right)
$$

Assume that every bidder's valuation for the object is drawn from a uniform distribution function between 0 and 1.

Uniform distribution function $U[0,1]$

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200526121350.jpg)

If bidder $i$ 's valuation is $v,$ then all points in the horizontal axis where $v_{j}<v$, entail probability $\operatorname{prob}\left(v_{i}<v\right)=F(v)$ in the vertical axis. I.e. $v=F(v)$.

Similarly, valuations where $v_{j}>v$ (horizontal axis) entail probability $\operatorname{prob}\left(v_{j}>v\right)=1-F(v)$ in the vertical axis. I.e. $1-F(v)=1-v$.

Since all bidders are ex-ante symmetric, they will all be using the same bidding function:
$$
b_{i}: v_i \in [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{+} \text{for every bidder } i
$$
They might, however, submit different bids, depending on their different valuation for the object.

Example:

- A valuation of $v_{i}=0.4$ inserted into a bidding function $b_{i}\left(v_{i}\right)=\frac{v_{i}}{2},$ implies a bid of $b_{i}(0.4)=\$ 0.2$

- A bidder with a higher valuation of $v_{i}=0.9$ implies, in contrast, a bid of $b_{i}(0.9)=\frac{0.9}{2}=\$ 0.45$

Even if bidders are symmetric in the bidding function they use, they can be asymmetric in the actual bid they submit

## 7.2 First-price Auctions / Dutch Auction

The Dutch Auction is strategically equivalent to FPA with sealed bid.

- Dutch auction is commonly used in many auction houses nowadays.
- An auctioneer begins by calling out a price high enough so that presumably no bidder is interested in buying the object at that price. The price is gradually lowered until some bidder indicates his/her interest. The object is
    sold to the bidder at the current price.
- Therefore, each bidder needs to have a “target price” (his bid) in mind, and to raise hand to indicate his interest when that price is called.

### 7.2.1 Risk Neutral Bidders

For risk neutral bidders, assume linear utility function
$$
u_i = v_i-b_i
$$
Then start by ruling out bidding strategies that yield negative (or zero) payoffs, regardless of what your opponent does, i.e., deleting dominated bidding strategies.

Never bid above your value, $b_{i}>v_{i},$ since it yields a negative payoff if winning.
$$
E U_{i}\left(b_{i} | v_{i}\right)=\operatorname{prob}(\operatorname{win}) \cdot \underbrace{\left(v_{i}-b_{i}\right)}_{\text{negtive}}+\operatorname{prob}(\operatorname{lose})\cdot 0<0
$$

Never bid your value, $b_{i}=v_{i},$ since it yields a zero payoff if winning.

$$
E U_{i}\left(b_{i} | v_{i}\right)=\operatorname{prob}(\operatorname{win}) \cdot \underbrace{\left(v_{i}-b_{i}\right)}_{0}+\operatorname{prob}(\text {lose}) \cdot 0=0
$$

Therefore, the only bidding strategies that can arise in equilibrium imply "bid shading",

- That is, $b_{i}<v_{i}$
- More specifically, $b_{i}\left(v_{i}\right)=a \cdot v_{i},$ where constant $a \in(0,1)$

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200526123001.jpg)

But, what is the precise value of parameter $a \in(0,1)$. That is, how much bid shadding?

Before answering that question, we must provide a more specific expression for the probability of winning in bidder $i$ 's expected utility of submitting a bid $x$,
$$
E U_{i}\left(x | v_{i}\right)=\operatorname{prob}(\operatorname{win}) \cdot\left(v_{i}-x\right)
$$
#### Uniform distribution $ v_i $

##### Two Bidders Case

Given symmetry in the bidding function, bidder $j$ can "recover" the valuation that produces a bid of exactly $\$ x$. From the vertical to the horizontal axis. Solving for $v_{i}$ in function $x=a \cdot v_{i},$ yields $v_{i}=\frac{x}{a}$.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200526123419.jpg)

What is, then, the probability of winning when submitting a bid $x$ is

- $prob(b_j < b_i )$ in the vertical axis, or
- $ prob( v_j < \frac{x}{a} ) $ in the horizontal axis.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200526143105.jpg)

And since valuations are uniformly distributed

- $ prob( v_j < \frac{x}{a} ) = \frac{x}{a}$
- which implies that the expected utility of submitting a bid $x$ is.

$$
E U_{i}\left(x | v_{i}\right)=\underbrace{\frac{x}{a}}_{\text {prob}(\text {win})}\left(v_{i}-x\right)
$$

And simplifying

$$
=\frac{x v_{i}-x^{2}}{a}
$$

Taking first-order conditions of $\frac{x v_{i}-x^{2}}{a}$ with respect to $x,$ we obtain

$$
\frac{v_{i}-2 x}{a}=0
$$

and solving for $x$ yields an optimal bidding function of

$$
x\left(v_{i}\right)=\frac{1}{2} v_{i}
$$

it means bid shadding in half.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200526143050.jpg)

##### N Bidders Case

The expected utility is similar, but the probability of winning
differs
$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{prob}(\operatorname{win}) &=\frac{x}{a} \cdot \ldots \cdot \frac{x}{a} \cdot \frac{x}{a} \cdot \ldots \cdot \frac{x}{a} \\
&=\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^{N-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence, the expected utility of submitting a bid $x$ is

$$
E U_{i}\left(x | v_{i}\right)=\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^{N-1}\left(v_{i}-x\right)+\left[1-\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^{N-1}\right] \cdot 0
$$

Taking first-order conditions with respect to his bid, $x,$ we obtain

$$
-\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^{N-1}+(N-1)\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^{N-2}\left(\frac{1}{a}\right)\left(v_{i}-x\right)=0
$$

Rearranging,

$$
\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^{N} \frac{a}{x^{2}}\left[(N-1) v_{i}-N x\right]=0
$$

and solving for $x$, we find bidder $i$ 's optimal bidding function,

$$
x\left(v_{i}\right)=\frac{N-1}{N} v_{i}
$$

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200526150813.jpg)

Comparative statics:

- Bid shadding diminishes as N increases.
- Bidding function approaches $45^o$ line.

#### Generalization $ v_i $

Let us now allow for valuations to be drawn from any CDF $F\left(v_{i}\right)$ (not necessarily uniform) First, note that, for a given bidding strategy $s:v_i \in [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{+}$, i.e., $s\left(v_{i}\right)=x_{i},$ we can define its inverse $s^{-1}\left(x_{i}\right)=v_{i}$ implying that the CDF can be rewritten as
$$
F\left(v_{i}\right)=F\left(s^{-1}\left(x_{i}\right)\right)
$$

Then bidder i's UMP becomes

$$
\max _{x_{i}} \underbrace{\left[F\left(s^{-1}\left(x_{i}\right)\right)\right]^{n-1}}_{\text {prob }(\text {win})}\left(v_{i}-x_{i}\right)
$$

Taking first-order conditions with respect to $x$ yields

$$
\begin{array}{c}
-\left[F\left(s^{-1}\left(x_{i}\right)\right)\right]^{n-1}+ \\
(n-1)\left[F\left(s^{-1}\left(x_{i}\right)\right)\right]^{n-2} f\left(s^{-1}\left(x_{i}\right)\right) \frac{d s^{-1}\left(x_{i}\right)}{d x_{i}}\left(v_{i}-x_{i}\right)=0
\end{array}
$$

since $s^{-1}\left(x_{i}\right)=v_{i}$ and $\frac{d s^{-1}\left(x_{i}\right)}{d x_{i}}=\frac{1}{s^{\prime}\left(s^{-1}\left(x_{i}\right)\right)},$ the above expression becomes

$$
-\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-1}+(n-1)\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-2} f\left(v_{i}\right) \frac{1}{s^{\prime}\left(v_{i}\right)}\left(v_{i}-x_{i}\right)=0
$$

Further rearranging, we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
&(n-1)\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-2} f\left(v_{i}\right) v_{i}-(n-1)\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-2} f\left(v_{i}\right) x_{i} \\
=&\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-1} s^{\prime}\left(v_{i}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Or

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-1} s^{\prime}\left(v_{i}\right)+(n-1)\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-2} f\left(v_{i}\right) v_{i} \\
=&(n-1)\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-2} f\left(v_{i}\right) x_{i}
\end{aligned}
$$

The $L H S$ is $\frac{d\left[\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-1} s\left(v_{i}\right)\right]}{d v_{i}} .$ Hence,

$$
\frac{d\left[\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-1} s\left(v_{i}\right)\right]}{d v_{i}}=(n-1)\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-2} f\left(v_{i}\right) x_{i}
$$

Integrating both sides yields

$$
\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-1} s\left(v_{i}\right)=\int_{0}^{v_{i}}(n-1)\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-2} f\left(v_{i}\right) v_{i} d v_{i} \quad (1)
$$

Applying integration by parts on the RHS, we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \int_{0}^{v_{i}}(n-1)\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-2} f\left(v_{i}\right) v_{i} d v_{i} \\
=&\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-1} v_{i}-\int_{0}^{v_{i}}\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-1} d v_{i} \quad (2)
\end{aligned}
$$

Plugging that into the RHS of (1) yields

$$
\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-1} s\left(v_{i}\right)=\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-1} v_{i}-\int_{0}^{v_{i}}\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-1} d v_{i} \quad (3)
$$

We can now rearrange expression (3). In particular, dividing both sides by $\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-1}$ yields

$$
s\left(v_{i}\right)=v_{i}-\frac{\int_{0}^{v_{i}}\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-1} d v_{i}}{\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-1}}
$$

which is bidder $i$ 's optimal bidding function, $s\left(v_{i}\right)$.

Intuitively, he shades his bid by the amount of ratio $\frac{\int_{0}^{v_{i}}\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-1} d v_{i}}{\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-1}}$.

As a practice, note that when $F\left(v_{i}\right)$ is uniform, $F\left(v_{i}\right)=v_{i}$ implying that $\left[F\left(v_{i}\right)\right]^{n-1}=v_{i}^{n-1} .$ Hence,
$$
s\left(v_{i}\right)=v_{i}-\frac{\frac{1}{n} v_{i}^{n}}{v_{i}^{n-1}}=v_{i}-\frac{v_{i}^{n}}{n v_{i}^{n-1}}=v_{i}\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)
$$

### 7.2.2 Risk-averse Bidders

Utility function is concave in income, $x,$ e.g., $u(x)=x^{\alpha}$

- where $0<\alpha \leq 1$ denotes bidder $i$ 's risk-aversion parameter.
- Note that when $\alpha=1$, the bidder is risk neutral.

Consider two bidders with $ v_i \sim U[0,1] $.

The expected utility of submitting a bid $x$ is
$$
E U_{i}\left(x | v_{i}\right)=\underbrace{\frac{x}{a}}_{\text {prob }(\text {win})}\left(v_{i}-x\right)^{\alpha}
$$

Taking first-order conditions with respect to his bid, $x$,
$$
\frac{1}{a}\left(v_{i}-x\right)^{\alpha}-\frac{x}{a} \alpha\left(v_{i}-x\right)^{\alpha-1}=0
$$

and solving for $x,$ we find the optimal bidding function,

$$
x\left(v_{i}\right)=\frac{v_{i}}{1+\alpha}
$$

Under risk-neutral bidders, $\alpha=1$, this function becomes $x\left(v_{i}\right)=\frac{v_{i}}{2}$.

But, what happens when $\alpha$ decreases (more risk aversion)?

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200526150756.jpg)

Bid shading is ameliorated as bidders' risk aversion increases: That is, the bidding function approaches the $ 45^o $ line when a approaches zero.

Intuition: for a risk-averse bidder:

- the **positive effect** of slightly lowering his bid, arising from getting the object at a cheaper price, is offset by...
- the negative effect of increasing the probability that he loses the auction.

Ultimately, the bidders' incentives to shade his bid are diminished.

## 7.3 Second-price Auctions / English Auction

The English Auction is strategically equivalent to SPA with sealed bid.

- English auction is also a commonly used form in auction houses.
- An auctioneer begins by calling out a low price and gradually raise it. Whoever wants to exit can exit the auction. The auctioneer keep on increasing the price as long as there are at least two interested bidders. The
    auction stops when there is only one interested bidder left. The object is sold to this bidder at the current price.
- Therefore, each bidder needs to have a target price (the bid) in mind and wait till the price reaches this price to drop out.

**Bidding your own valuation, $b_{i}\left(v_{i}\right)=v_{i}$, is a weakly dominant strategy**, i.e., it yields a larger (or the same) payoff than submitting any other bid.

In order to show this, let us find the expected payoff from submitting

- A bid that coincides with your own valuation, $b_{i}\left(v_{i}\right)=v_{i}$
- A bid that lies below your own valuation, $b_{i}\left(v_{i}\right)<v_{i}$
- A bid that lies above your own valuation, $b_{i}\left(v_{i}\right)>v_{i}$

We can then compare which bidding strategy yields the largest expected payoff

Bidding your own valuation, $b_{i}\left(v_{i}\right)=v_{i}$

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200526210846.jpg)

Bidding your own valuation:

- If his bid lies below the highest competing bid, i.e. $b_{i}<h_{i}$ where $h_{i}=\max _{j \neq i}\left\{b_{j}\right\}$ then bidder $i$ loses the auction, obtaining a zero payoff.

- Case 1 b: If his bid lies above the highest competing bid, i.e. $b_{i}>h_{i},$ then bidder $i$ wins. He obtains a net payoff of $v_{i}-h_{i}$ end-price auctions.

- Case 1 c: If, instead, his bid coincides with the highest competing bid, i.e., $b_{i}=h_{i},$ then a tie occurs. For simplicity, ties are solved by randomly assigning the object to the bidders who submitted the highest bids
    as a consequence, bidder i's expected payoff becomes $\frac{1}{2}\left(v_{i}-h_{i}\right)$.

Bidding below your valuation, $b_{i}\left(v_{i}\right)<v_{i}$

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200526210800.jpg)

Bidding below your valuation ( compare to $v=v_i$ case by case):

- Case 2 a: If his bid lies below the highest competing bid, i.e., $ b_i < h_i $, then bidder $i$ loses, obtaining a zero payoff.

- Case 2 b: if his bid lies above the highest competing bid, i.e. $b_{i}>h_{i}$, then bidder $i$ wins, obtaining a net payoff of $v_{i}-h_{i}$
- Case 2 c: If, instead, his bid coincides with the highest competing bid, i.e., $b_{i}=h_{i},$ then a tie occurs, and the object is randomly assigned, yielding an expected payoff of $\frac{1}{2}\left(v_{i}-h_{i}\right)$.

Bidding above your valuation, $b_{i}\left(v_{i}\right)>v_{i}$

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200526210719.jpg)

Bidding above your valuation ( compare to $v=v_i$ case by case):

- Case 3 a: if his bid lies below the highest competing bid, i.e. $b_{i}<h_{i}$, then bidder $i$ loses, obtaining a zero payoff.

- Case 3 b: if his bid lies above the highest competing bid, i.e. $b_{i}>h_{i},$ then bidder $i$ wins. His payoff becomes $v_{i}-h_{i},$ which is positive if $v_{i}>h_{i},$ or negative otherwise.
- Case 3 c: If, instead, his bid coincides with the highest competing bid, i.e., $b_{i}=h_{i},$ then a tie occurs. The object is randomly assigned, yielding an expected payoff of $\frac{1}{2}\left(v_{i}-h_{i}\right)$, which is negative.

Summary:

- There is no bidding strategy that provides a strictly higher payoff than $b_{i}\left(v_{i}\right)=v_{i}$ in the SPA.
- All players bid their own valuation, without shading their bids, unlike in the optimal bidding function in FPA.
- The above equilibrium bidding strategy in the SPA is unaffected by:
    - the number of bidders who participate in the auction, N, or
    - their risk-aversion preferences.

## 7.4 Efficiency in auctions

The object is assigned to the bidder with the highest valuation. Otherwise, the outcome of the auction cannot be efficient, since there exist alternative reassignments that would still improve welfare.

Hence, FPA and SPA are efficient, since: the player with the highest valuation submits the highest bid and wins the auction.

Lottery auctions are not necessarily efficient, since it's random allocation between bidders.
