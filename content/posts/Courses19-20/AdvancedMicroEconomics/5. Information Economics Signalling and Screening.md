# 5. Information Economics: Signalling and Screening

Information economics: extensive-form (dynamic) games with incomplete (asymmetric) information.

- Sequential rationality + consistent beliefs ) Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium

- Signalling (MWG 13.B, 13.C, JR 8.1.1, 8.1.2)
- Competitive Screening (MWG 13.D, JR 8.1.3) (NOTE: this is to be distinguished from “monopolistic screening” of MWG 14.C!)

Asymmetric information exists among agents when one or more agents possess information that others don’t, and it affects agents’ payoffs in the game. 

## 5.1 Adverse Selection

### 5.1.1 The Market for Lemons (Akerlof 1972)

The adverse selection problem

- One party/player has hidden characteristics (about oneself), where asymmetric information exists before the parties enter into a relationship.

- e.g. In the trading game, seller has information about what good he/she is (potentially) selling, before seeing the price and trading with the buyer.

The Market for Lemons (Akerlof 1972)

- In the market, buyers often do not observe the quality of the cars, which is privately information of the sellers. Due to the common existence of low quality used cars (the “lemons”), buyers will be reluctant to pay high price for a high quality car (the “orange”), since they cannot tell its quality.

- As a consequence of low market prices, high quality sellers are driven out of the market (they lose if they sell), and whoever sells on the market is more likely to be selling a low quality car.

- The market mechanism selects the adverse (bad) type of the good, thus it is called “adverse selection.”

Imagine a decision task. Half of you will act as a "Seller" and the other half of you a "Buyer."

Each seller will be assigned a good that values $v_{s}$ to the himself/herself. The value of $v_{s}$ depends on the type of the good one receives: orange or lemon.

- An orange values $v_{s}=20$ and a lemon values $v_{s}=5$ to the seller.
- Half of the sellers will receive an orange and the other half will receive a lemon. But whoever has received orange or lemon is one's private information. 

Each buyer's value of the good is $v_{b} .$ An orange values $v_{b}=30$ and a lemon values $v_{b}=7$ to the buyer.

The timing and decisions

- Each buyer proposes a price $P$ at which you would like to purchase.
- This price will then be communicated to a corresponding seller. The seller observes the price $P$ and decide "Sell" or "Not-Sell."

Payoffs

- If the seller chooses "Not-Sell" then both of them get 0 (no trade).
- If the seller chooses "Sell" then trade happens and the buyer pays the price
    $P$ to the seller.
    - If the seller had an orange, seller's net gain is $P-20$ and buyer's net gain $30-P$
    - If the seller had a lemon, seller's net gain is $P-5$ and buyer's net gain $7-P$.

Efficiency: since $v_{b}>v_{s}$ for both oranges and lemons, if trade happens in both markets, all sellers and buyers enjoy gain from trade $10+2=12$.

Question: will trade happen for both orange and lemon between rational sellers and buyers?

Ans: No. With buyers' rational expectation, there will be no trade on the market for oranges.

- First, will buyer offer a price $P>20 ?$ No. With 0.5 probability buyer will face a seller with a lemon; $7-P<0$ if $P>20$
- Buyer at most willing to offer a price $P \leq 0.5 \cdot 30+0.5 \cdot 7=18.5$
- Will the orange seller sell at such price? No. Seller would rather not trade:

$$
P-20<0 \text { if } P \leq 18.5
$$
The only PBE (also SPNE) outcome of the game is $P \leq 18.5,$ orange seller does not sell, and lemon seller sells. The gain from trade is only 2 and the market does not achieve efficiency.

One of the players knows something pertinent to the outcomes that the other player don’t know:

- An employer knows much less about the skills of a potential employee than does the employee himself,
- An insurance company knows much less about health or driving skills of someone applying for medical or auto insurance than does the applicant.
- The seller of a used car knows a lot about the car from long experience while a potential buyer can at best get a little information by inspection.

### 5.1.2 Solutions to adverse selection

**Signaling**: the seller of a high quality car can (costly) signal to potential buyers by offering a long warranty, which is not affordable to low quality car sellers, as a way to distinguish them from low quality car sellers. e.g. 保修

**Screening**: the uninformed party offers a term of exchange such that the informed party can choose to accept or reject.

e.g. An uninformed buyer can ask for a long enough warranty to screen out low quality sellers. Or an uninformed insurance company, who is uninformed of health conditions of the clients, offers different insurance packages, and ideally, each type of clients only find one package acceptable.

Nobel prize (2001) in economics was awarded to George Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph Stiglitz for their contribution on signaling and screening models.

## 5.2 Job Market Signaling

### 5.2.1 Assumption

One way to resolve the inefficient market equilibria caused by asymmetric information.

Key idea of the job-market signaling model

- A worker knows about his/her ability while the firm does not. The worker can use education level to “signal” ability.
- Education is time-consuming and effort-taking. Hence it’s more painful for the low-ability workers.
- If the firm sets up the wages appropriately depending on education levels, then the high-ability workers are able to distinguish themselves out, even if education could be otherwise useless.

We consider a model with two types of workers, $\theta_{H}$ and $\theta_{L},$ where
$$
\theta_{H}>\theta_{L}>0 \text { and } \lambda=\operatorname{Pr}\left(\theta=\theta_{H}\right) \in(0,1)
$$
Before entering the job market, a worker can get some education. **The amount of education a worker receives is observable.**

Education does nothing for a worker's productivity. Assume "**useless education**."

The **cost of obtaining education** level $e$ for a type $\theta$ worker is given by the twice continuous differentiable function $c(e, \theta),$ with

- $c(0, \theta)=0 .$ Zero education, zero cost for both types.
- $c_{e}(e, \theta)>0$ and $c_{e e}(e, \theta)>0 .$ cost is increasing (marginal cost positive) and convex (marginal cost increasing) with education level.
- $c_{\theta}(e, \theta)<0$ for all $e>0 .$ cost decreases with ability (type); i.e. a given level (e.g. $e=16$ yrs) of education is less costly for a high-ability and more costly for a low-ability worker: $c\left(16, \theta_{H}\right)<c\left(16, \theta_{L}\right)$
- $c_{e \theta}(e, \theta)<0 .$ High-ability worker has lower marginal cost of education than Iow-ability worker does; i.e.

$$
\frac{\partial c\left(e, \theta_{H}\right)}{\partial e}<\frac{\partial c\left(e, \theta_{L}\right)}{\partial e}
$$

The utility of a type $\theta$ worker who chooses education level $e$ and receives wage $w$ is $u(w, e | \theta)=w-c(e, \theta)$

A worker of type $\theta$ can earn $r(\theta)$ by working at home. We assume that $r\left(\theta_{H}\right)=r\left(\theta_{L}\right)=0$ (for simplicity) 

In the absence of the ability of signal, all workers are employed at $w^{*}=E[\theta],$ which is Pareto inefficient.

Note: we model a single worker of unknown type, but this could be thought of as multiple workers.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200421125647.png)

For each type $\theta$, one indifference curve represents a utility level $\bar{u}$ of this worker, i.e.
$$
w-c(e, \theta)=\bar{u} \Rightarrow \frac{\partial w}{\partial e}=c_{e}(e, \theta)
$$
Indifference curves are also convex since $c_{e e}(e, \theta)>0$

The property that $\frac{\partial c\left(e, \theta_{H}\right)}{\partial e}<\frac{\partial c\left(e, \theta_{L}\right)}{\partial e}$ implies type $\theta_{H}$ 's indifference curves are flatter and type $\theta_{L}$ 's indifference curves are steeper.

**Exercise**: A Numerical Example
$$
u(w, e | \theta)=w-\frac{e^{3}}{\theta}
$$
- That is, the cost $c(e, \theta)=e^{3} / \theta .$ Check for the 4 assumptions about the cost function. Fixed a value of $\theta,$ draw the graph of $c(e, \theta)$ as a function of $e$
- Suppose $\theta_{L}=2, \theta_{H}=4 .$ Draw the families of indifference curves for both types of workers.
- For each type of workers, what are the utility levels represented by the indifference curve passing through point $(e=0, w=2),(e=2, w=4)$ or $(e=\sqrt[3]{4}, w=4) ?$

Timeline of the dynamic game 

- Random move of nature determines the type of the worker. 
- Conditional on her type, the worker chooses how much education to obtain. The worker enters the job market. 
- Conditional on the observed education level, two firms simultaneously make wage offers. 

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200421141836.png)

- Worker decides whether to work and, if so, for which firm. 

We look at perfect Bayesian equilibrium and focus on pure strategies.

A set of strategies and a belief function $\mu\left(\theta_{H} | e\right) \in[0,1]$ giving the firms' common probability assessment that the worker is of high ability after observing $e$ is a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium if

- The worker's strategy is optimal given the firm's strategies.
- $\mu\left(\theta_{H} | e\right)$ is derived from the worker's strategy using Bayes' rule whenever possible.
- The firms' wage offers following each choice $e$ constitute a **Nash equilibrium** of the simultaneous-move wage offer game in which the probability that the worker is of high ability is $\mu\left(\theta_{H} | e\right)$

Given $\mu\left(\theta_{H} | e\right),$ the expected productivity of the worker is
$$
\mu\left(\theta_{H} | e\right) \cdot \theta_{H}+\left(1-\mu\left(\theta_{H} | e\right)\right) \cdot \theta_{L}
$$
In a simultaneous-move wage offer game, **the firms' equilibrium wage offers equal the worker's expected productivity**.

### 5.2.2 Separating PBE

"Perfect Bayesian Equilibria with **Separating Types**": two types of workers choose different education levels.

【Lemma 1】In any separating perfect Bayesian equilibrium, $w^{*}\left(e^{*}\left(\theta_{H}\right)\right)=\theta_{H}$ and $w^{*}\left(e^{*}\left(\theta_{L}\right)\right)=\theta_{L}$

Proof: 

- In any PBE, beliefs on the equilibrium path must be correctly derived from the equilibrium strategies using Bayes' rule.

- Upon seeing education level $e^{*}\left(\theta_{L}\right),$ firms must assign probability 1 to the worker being type $\theta_{L}$. So $w^{*}\left(e^{*}\left(\theta_{L}\right)\right)=\theta_{L} .$ Otherwise, firms will either have negative profit, or the low-ability worker reject the offer.

- similarly, upon seeing $e^{*}\left(\theta_{H}\right),$ assign probability 1 to the worker being type $\theta_{H}$

【Lemma 2】In any separating perfect Bayesian equilibrium, $e^{*}\left(\theta_{L}\right)=0 ;$ that is, a low-ability worker chooses to get no education.

Proof and an illustration:

- Suppose not. Suppose that $\theta_{L}$ chooses $\hat{e}>0$.
- If this is an equilibrium, then the low-ability worker will receive $\theta_{L}$ according to the previous lemma.
- However, if $e=0$, the worker can still receive at least $\theta_{L}$ (for any belief on $\left.\theta_{L} \text { and } \theta_{H}\right)$.That presents a profitable deviation.

Let us construct a few separating PBEs. The equilibrium needs to satisfy:

- For the firm (uninformed player), we need to figure out the consistent belief along equilibrium path (Bayes' Rule), the optimal response of wage schedule $w(e)$ given this belief, and beliefs off-the-equilibrium.
- For each type of worker (informed player), given $w(e),$ no deviation to choose the other type's education level, or any off-the-equilibrium education level. (Question: what properties needed for $w(e)$ to ensure this no-deviation of each-type-worker?)

Note: in the graphs we use abbreviation $e_{L}$ to represent $e^{*}\left(\theta_{L}\right)$ and $e_{H}$ to represent $e^{*}\left(\theta_{H}\right)$.

#### Separating PBE 1 

With One Possible Wage Schedule

Firm's beliefs

- On-the-equilibrium: after observing $e_{L}(=0)$ or $e_{H}(>0),$ firm assigns $\mu^{*}\left(\theta_{H} | e_{L}\right)=0$ and $\mu^{*}\left(\theta_{H} | e_{H}\right)=1$
- Off-the-equilibrium: if observing an education level $e \neq e_{L}, e \neq e_{H}$ and $e>0,$ firm assigns $\mu^{*}\left(\theta_{H} | e\right) \in[0,1] .$ **Arbitrary belief as in PBE, but to be further restricted later (by the Intuitive Criterion)**.

Firm's optimal response $w^{*}(e)$ given the belief

- In general, conditional on each possible education choice $e,$ wage schedule satisfies $w^{*}(e)=\mu^{*}\left(\theta_{H} | e\right) \cdot \theta_{H}+\left(1-\mu^{*}\left(\theta_{H} | e\right)\right) \cdot \theta_{L}$
- On-the-equilibrium: $w^{*}\left(e_{L}\right)=\theta_{L}$ and $w^{*}\left(e_{H}\right)=\theta_{H}$
- Off-the-equilibrium: $w^{*}(e) \in\left[\theta_{L}, \theta_{H}\right],$ plus some additional properties (see the illustration).

For the low type $e^{*}\left(\theta_{L}\right)=0,$ the Incentive Compatibility conditions:

- Choosing any other $e>0, \neq e_{H}$ is more costly (lower utility) to acquire, the wage schedule should make it indeed optimal for $\theta_{L}$ to choose $e^{*}\left(\theta_{L}\right)=0$
    - In particular, $\theta_{L}$ should have NO incentive to mimic the high type $\theta_{H}$; i.e. by acquiring education level $e_{H}$ and being paid $w^{*}\left(e_{H}\right)=\theta_{H},$ type $\theta_{L}$ does not get higher utility.
- In the graph, deviation to education level $e_{1}>0$ or $e_{2}>0$ are unprofitable.
- The indifference curves lying on $(w, e)$ -pairs $A$ and $B$ should be associated to a lower utility level than the indifference curve passing through$\left(w=\theta_{L}, e=0\right)$

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200421162204.png)

For the high type $e^{*}\left(\theta_{H}\right)>0,$ the Incentive Compatibility conditions:

- He chooses the prescribed education level $e_{H}>0$ there is NO incentive to mimic the low-type worker:

$$
u(\underbrace{\theta_{H}}_{w^{*}\left(e_{H}\right)}, e_{H} | \theta_{H}) \geq u(\underbrace{\theta_{L}}_{w^{*}\left(e_{L}\right)}, \underbrace{0}_{e_{L}} | \theta_{H})
$$
- In addition, he has no incentive to deviate any off-the-equilibrium education level $e>0, e \neq e_{H}$

$$
u\left(\theta_{H}, e_{H} | \theta_{H}\right) \geq u\left(w^{*}(e), e | \theta_{H}\right)
$$

In the graph, deviation to $e_{1}$ or $e_{2},$ given $w(e),$ induces $(w, e)$ -pairs $A$ and $B$ respectively. In this equilibrium. the indifference curve of the high type passing through the point $\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)$ such that $\theta_{H}-c\left(e_{H}, \theta_{L}\right)=\theta_{L}-c\left(0, \theta_{L}\right)$ (not necessarily)

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200421165210.png)

There is another wage possible wage schedule that supports the same separating strategies $e_{L}=0, e_{H}$ such that $\theta_{H}-c\left(e_{H}, \theta_{L}\right)=\theta_{L}-c\left(0, \theta_{L}\right)$

- Difference in the wage schedule $w(e)$ only entails distinct responses by the firm to off-the-equilibrium education levels $e \neq e_{L}, e \neq e_{H}$ ($ w^{*}\left(e_{H}\right)=\theta_{H}, w^{*}\left(e_{L}\right)=\theta_{L} $ unchanged).
- This wage schedule in the graph means any $0<e<e_{H}$ still identifies someone as a low-type worker, entailing a wage $w^{*}(e)=\theta_{L}$
- Deviations to education levels $e_{1}$ or $e_{2}$ is still, of course, unprofitable since it would yield $(w, e)$ -pairs $A$ and $B$ below the indifference curves, respectively.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200421171237.png)

#### Separating PBE 2

In this separating equilibrium, $e_{L}=0, e_{H}$ such that $\theta_{H}-c\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)=\theta_{L}-c\left(0, \theta_{H}\right)$

Firm's beliefs

- on-the-equilibrium: $\mu^{*}\left(\theta_{H} | e_{L}\right)=0$ and $\mu^{*}\left(\theta_{H} | e_{H}\right)=1$
- off-the-equilibrium: upon observing an education level $e \in\left(0, e_{3}\right) \cup\left[e_{3}, e_{H}\right)$, $\mu^{*}\left(\theta_{H} | e\right) \in[0,1] .$ Arbitrary belief as in $\mathrm{PBE},$ but to be further restricted later (by the Intuitive Criterion).

Firm's optimal response $w^{*}(e)$ given the belief

- on-the-equilibrium: $w^{*}\left(e_{L}\right)=\theta_{L}$ and $w^{*}\left(e_{H}\right)=\theta_{H}$
- off-the-equilibrium: $w^{*}(e) \in\left[\theta_{L}, \theta_{H}\right],$ plus the additional properties (lying below both types' indifference curves).

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200502224557.png)

The low type $\theta_{L}$ 's Incentive Compatibility conditions:

- Choosing any other $e>0,$ including $e_{H},$ will induce a $\left(w^{*}(e), e\right)$ -pair (e.g. points $A$ or $B$ ) results in a lower utility level. So it is indeed optimal to choose $e^{*}\left(\theta_{L}\right)=0$

The high type $\theta_{H}$ 's Incentive Compatibility conditions:

- He does not reach a strictly higher utility level by mimicing the low-type worker:

$$
U(\underbrace{\theta_{H}}_{w^{*}\left(e_{H}\right)}, e_{H} | \theta_{H})=u(\underbrace{\theta_{L}}_{w^{*}\left(e_{L}\right)}, \underbrace{0}_{e_{L}} | \theta_{H})
$$

- In addition, given $w^{*}(e),$ he has no incentive to deviate any off-the-equilibrium education level $e>0, e \neq e_{H}$

$$
u\left(\theta_{H}, e_{H} | \theta_{H}\right) \geq u\left(w^{*}(e), e | \theta_{H}\right)
$$
- In the graph, deviation to $e_{1}$ or $e_{2}$ induces $(w, e)$ -pairs $A$ and $B$ respectively, both of which below $\theta_{H}$ 's indifference curve.

#### Summary

There are multiple separating PBEs of the job-market signalling game:

- Same separating strategies of the workers (choice of education levels), but with a different off-equilibrium wage schedule. As long as $w^{*}(e)$ lies below both types' indifference curves.
- Separating equilibria with a difference choice of $e_{H}$ of the high-ability type (while $e_{L}=0$ always). Any education level between $\tilde{e}_{H}$ (such that $\left.\theta_{H}-c\left(\tilde{e_{H}}, \theta_{L}\right)=\theta_{L}-c\left(0, \theta_{L}\right)\right)$ and $\hat{e}_{H}$ (such that
    $\left.\theta_{H}-c\left(\hat{e}_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)=\theta_{L}-c\left(0, \theta_{H}\right)\right)$ can be supported as different separating PBES.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200503110842.png)

- The education levels that cannot be sustained as a separating PBE:
    - $e \in\left(0, \tilde{e}_{H}\right),$ low-ability type would have an incentive to choose high-ability type's education level.
    - $e>\hat{e}_{H},$ high-ability type would have an incentive to choose low-ability type's education level.

The equilibria can be Pareto ranked.

- ln all of them, firms earn zero profit, and a low-ability worker's utility is $\theta_{L}$
- The separating equilibrium in which the high-ability worker gets education level $\tilde{e}_{H}$ Pareto dominates all the others (the least cost of education).
- Interpretation: **over education**(联想中国经济现状)
    - ln some equilibria, there are too much" education. But given that it is an equilibrium and the firms' beliefs, no one has incentive to deviate.
    - That is, if everyone gets a college degree, there's no reason for a person to only get a high-school degree. In US, 92 percent people have higher-than-high-school degrees. 

### 5.2.3 Pooling Equilibria

"Perfect Bayesian Equilibria with Pooling Types": two types of workers choose same education level; i.e.$e^{*}\left(\theta_{L}\right)=e^{*}\left(\theta_{H}\right)=e^{*}$

In any pooling equilibrium, firms' belief and wage on-the-equilibrium (upon observing $e^{*}$ ):
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu\left(\theta_{H} | e^{*}\right) &=\lambda \\
w^{*}\left(e^{*}\right) &=\lambda \cdot \theta_{H}+(1-\lambda) \cdot \theta_{L}=E(\theta)
\end{aligned}
$$
Firm's belief and wage off-the-equilibrium:

- upon observing $e=0: \mu\left(\theta_{H} | e=0\right)=0$ and $w^{*}(e=0)=\theta_{L}$
- upon observing $0<e \neq e^{*}: \mu\left(\theta_{H} | e\right) \in[0,1]$ and $w^{*}(e) \in\left[\theta_{L}, \theta_{H}\right]$ with the additional properties that $w^{*}(e)$ lies below both types' indifference curves.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200503114325.png)

Consider the pooling education level $e^{*}$ such that $E(\theta)-c\left(e^{*}, \theta_{L}\right)=\theta_{L}-c\left(0, \theta_{L}\right)$

The low type $\theta_{L}$ 's Incentive Compatibility conditions:

- Given $w^{*}(e),$ deviation from the pooling education level $e^{*}$ (e.g. to $e_{1}$ or $e_{2}$ ) yields $(w, e)$ -pairs $C$ or $D,$ which entails a lower utility than point $A$ $\left(\left(E(\theta), e^{*}\right)\right)$

- In particular, deviating to $e=0$ does not result in a strictly higher utility for type $\theta_{L}$

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200503115300.png)

The high type $\theta_{H}$ 's Incentive Compatibility conditions:

- Given $w^{*}(e),$ deviation from $e^{*}$ (e.g. to $e_{1}$ or $e_{2}$ ) is also unprofitable; i.e. $(w, e)$ -pairs $\mathrm{C}$ or $\mathrm{D}$ are both below high-ability type's indifference curve which passes through point $\mathrm{A}\left(\left(E(\theta), e^{*}\right)\right)$

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200503115322.png)

Finally, we have

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200503115351.png)

There are also multiple pooling PBEs of the job-market signalling game:

- Same pooling strategies of the workers (choice of education levels), but with a different off-equilibrium wage schedule. As long as $w^{*}(e)$ lies below both types' indifference curves.
- Pooling equilibria with a difference choice of the pooling education level $e^{\prime}$. Any education level $e^{\prime} \in\left[0, e^{*}\right]$ can be supported as different pooling PBEs.
    - Intuition, if in a pooling equilibrium with some $e^{\prime}<e^{*}$, both types would actually be happier than in the $e^{*}$ case: they would still receive $w=E(\theta)$ while incur less education cost.
- The education levels that cannot be sustained as a pooling PBE:
    - $e>e^{*},$ low-ability type would rather deviate to $e=0$ and receive $w^{*}(e=0)=\theta_{L} . $ An illustration.	

Again, we can Pareto rank all the pooling equilibria: $e^{\prime}=0$ no education (no-signaling-via-edu) dominates all the others.

### 5.2.4 Intuitive Criterion Refinement

There are multiple equilibria (both separating and pooling equilibria). We are going to adopt the Intuitive Criterion to refine them.

The multiplicity stems from the freedom to choose beliefs off the equilibrium path. Can we put any reasonable restrictions on such beliefs?

- e.g. Consider one separating PBE in which $\left\{e^{*}\left(\theta_{L}\right)=0, e^{*}\left(\theta_{H}\right)=\hat{e}_{H}\right\} .$ To sustain $\hat{e}_{H}$ as the equilibrium education level of high-ability workers, firms must believe that any worker with an education level $e \in\left[\tilde{e}_{H}, \hat{e}_{H}\right]$ has a positive probability of being of type $\theta_{L} .$ Is this a reasonable belief?
- Note that a type $\theta_{L}$ worker could never be made better off choosing such an education level than she is getting at $e=0,$ regardless of what firms believe about her.
- If workers with high productivity expect $ w(e)=\theta_L $, for $\tilde{e}_{H}<e<\hat{e}_{H}$. Than he has incentive to move from $\hat{e}_H$ to $e$. 
- So for $\tilde{e}_{H}<e<\hat{e}_{H},$ any belief other than $\mu\left(\theta_{H} | e\right)=1$ seems unreasonable. Only the high-ability worker would deviate to education level $e$. This implies the firm to set a wage such that $w(e)=\theta_{H}$

#### Separating PBEs

Let us check it the separating equilibrium $e_{L}^{*}=0$ and $e_{H}^{*}=e_{2}$ survives the Intuitive Criterion.

Hence, let us consider any off-the-equilibrium message $e \in\left(e_{1}, e_{2}\right) .$ (Green color)

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200503161955.png)

The $\theta_{L}$ -type of worker doesn't have incentives to deviate towards e since:
$$
\underbrace{u_{L}^{*}\left(\theta_{L}\right)}_{\text {Equil. Payoff }}>\underbrace{\max _{w \in W^{*}(\theta, m)} u_{L}\left(e, w, \theta_{L}\right)}_{\text {Highest payoff from deviating towards } e}
$$
[Given that any Indifference Curve passing through any $e \in\left(e_{1}, e_{2}\right) \text { and } w=\theta_{H} $ lies below the equilibrium $IC_L$].

But the $\theta_{H}$ -type of worker has incentives to deviate:
$$
\underbrace{u_{i}^{*}\left(\theta_{H}\right)}_{\text {Equil. payoff }}<\underbrace{\max _{w \in W^{*}(\theta, e)} u_{H}\left(e, w, \theta_{H}\right)}_{\text {Highest payoff of deviating towards } e}
$$
[since any Indifference Curve passing through any $e \in\left(e_{1}, e_{2}\right)$ and $\left.w=\theta_{H} \text { lies above the equilibrium } I C_{H}\right]$

Therefore, education levels in $e \in\left(e_{1}, e_{2}\right)$ can only come from the $\theta_{H}$ -worker, and $\Theta^{* *}(e)=\left\{\theta_{H}\right\}$

Given that $e$ only comes from $\theta_{H},$ the firm offers a wage $w(e)=\theta_{H}$ after observing $e$
$$
\underbrace{\min _{w \in W^{*}\left(\Theta^{* *}(e), e\right)} 
u_{H}\left(e, w, \theta_{H}\right)}_{\theta_{H}-c\left(e, \theta_{H}\right)}>\underbrace{u_{H}^{*}\left(\theta_{H}\right)}_{\theta_{H}-c\left(e_{2}, \theta_{H}\right)}
$$
since, $e_{2}>e,$ then $c\left(e_{2}, \theta_{H}\right)>c\left(e, \theta_{H}\right) .$ Hence
$$
\theta_{H}-c\left(e, \theta_{H}\right)>\theta_{H}-c\left(e_{2}, \theta_{H}\right)
$$
Intuitively, the lowest payoff that the $\theta_{H}$ -worker obtains by deviating towards $e$ is higher than his equilibrium payoff.

Therefore, the separating PBE
$$
\left\{e_{L}^{*}\left(\theta_{L}\right), e_{H}^{*}\left(\theta_{H}\right)\right\}=\left\{0, e_{2}\right\}
$$
violates the Intuitive Criterion.

Finally,we can find that the only separating PBE that survive the intuitive criterion is 
$$
\left\{e_{L}^{*}\left(\theta_{L}\right), e_{H}^{*}\left(\theta_{H}\right)\right\}=\left\{0, e_{1}\right\}
$$

#### Pooling PBEs

Which of all the poollng PBEs we found survive the Intuitive criterion? None!

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200503212914.png)

- 1st Step: If the firm observes an off-the-equilibrium message $e^{\prime}(\text { see next figure }),$ it can understand that such a message is never equilibrium deviated for the high-productive worker since
$$
u^{*}\left(E[\theta], e^{*} | \theta_{H}\right)<\max _{w} u\left(w, e^{\prime} | \theta_{H}\right)
$$
- while this inequality does not held for the low-productive worker

$$
u^{*}\left(E[\theta], e^{*} | \theta_{L}\right)>\max _{w} u\left(w, e^{\prime} | \theta_{L}\right)
$$
- Hence, the firm can restrict its beliefs to $\theta_{H}$ after observing the off-the-equilibrium message $e^{\prime},$ i.e., $H^{* *}\left(e^{\prime}\right)=\theta_{H}$

2 Ad Step: After restricting beliefs to $H^{* *}\left(e^{\prime}\right)=\theta_{H}$, the firm responds with a wage $w\left(e^{\prime}\right)=\theta_{H}$ after observing $e$. The high-productive worker has incentives to deviate from the pooling education level $e^{*}$ to $e^{\prime}$ since
$$
\theta_{H}-c\left(e^{\prime}, \theta_{H}\right)>E[\theta]-c\left(e^{*}, \theta_{H}\right) 
$$
or
$$
\theta_{H}-E[\theta]>c\left(e^{\prime}, \theta_{H}\right)-c\left(e^{*}, \theta_{H}\right)
$$
We have thus found one type of sender (high-prod. worker) and one off-the-equilibrium message he could send (any $\left.e^{\prime} \in\left[e_{1}, e_{2}\right]\right)$ that would provide him with a higher utility level than at the pooling $P B E$ in which both types of sender select
$e^{*} .$ 

Hence, such pooling PBE violates the intuitive criterion.
A similar argument applies to all other pooling PBEs (practice). Hence, no pooling PBE in the labor market signaling game survives the intuitive criterion. Only the least-costly separating PBE survives the intuitive criterion. 

Of course, all other Pooling PBEs also violate the intuitive criterion.

#### Summary

Hence, the only PBE surviving the Cho and Kreps (1987) Intuitive Criterion is the least-costly separating equilibrium.

We compare this surviving PBE (the "best case" of job market signalling) with the case of no signaling $(e=0, w=E(\theta)$ adverse selection):

- Low-ability workers are strictly worse off with signaling because they receive $\theta_{L}$ rather than $E(\theta)$. Indeed, without signalling, the low type would reach the indifference curve passing through $(E(\theta), 0),$ which yields a strictly higher utility $\forall \lambda \in(0,1)$

- For higher-ability workers no-signaling vs. signaling
    - Better off with signaling when $\lambda$ is low; i.e. the majority are low-ability workers.
    - Worse off with signaling when $\lambda$ is high; i.e. the majority are high-ability workers.

## 5.3 Asymmetric Information and Screening

The major problem with using education as a signaling device: multiple equilibria, some of which are not Pareto efficient.

An alternative approach: uninformed parties take steps to try to
distinguish, or screen, the various types of individuals on the other side of the market.

Firms can **design multiple contracts** for the workers to choose. Each contract consists of a wage level and a task with certain difficulty.

**No pooling equilibrium exists**. Low-ability can never pretend to be a high-ability and get high wage. The high-ability can distinguish themselves from the low-ability by choosing the high wage and harder task.

### 5.3.1 Assumption

Suppose there are only two types of workers, $\theta_{L}$ and $\theta_{H},$ with $\theta_{H}>\theta_{L}$ and where the fraction of workers of type $\theta_{H}$ is $\lambda \in(0,1)$.

Further assume that $r\left(\theta_{L}\right)=r\left(\theta_{H}\right)=0$

Suppose that jobs may differ in the "task level" required of the worker.

We assume that higher task levels add nothing to the output of the worker, and their only effect is to lower the worker's utility.
This is to say that the output of type $\theta$ worker remains to be $\theta$ regardless of the task level.

Utility of a type $\theta$ worker who receives $w$ and faces task level $t \geq 0$ is $u(w, t | \theta)=w-c(t, \theta)$

We assume that $c(0, \theta)=0, c_{t}(t, \theta)>0, c_{t t}(t, \theta)>0, c_{\theta}(t, \theta)<0$ for all $t>0,$ and $c_{t \theta}(t, \theta)<0$

**Timing of the game**:

1. Two firms simultaneously announce sets of offered contracts. A contract is pair $(w, t) .$ Each firm may announce any finite number of contracts.

2. Given the offers made by the firms, workers of each type choose whether to accept a contract and, if so, which one.

    - Indifference is resolved in favor of lower task level and employment.

    - Indifference between firms is resolved by a flip of a coin.

Note: since the firms move before workers' move, there is no information based on which the firms would update "belief".

### 5.3.2 Equilibrium

【Lemma (13.D.1)】In any equilibrium, whether pooling or separating, both firms must earn zero profits.

##### Proof:

Let $\left(w_{L}, t_{L}\right)$ and $\left(w_{H}, t_{H}\right)$ be the contracts chosen by the low- and high-ability workers. They could be the same.

Suppose $\Pi>0$ is the aggregate profits. Firms are making positive profit.

Consider that this firm deviates and offer $\left(w_{L}+\epsilon, t_{L}\right)$ and $\left(w_{H}+\epsilon, t_{H}\right)$ for $\epsilon>0 .$ The contracts will attract all respective types of workers.

Incentive compatibility ( $i$, j be the two types of workers):
$$
w_{i}-c\left(t_{i}, \theta_{i}\right) \geq w_{j}-c\left(t_{j}, \theta_{i}\right) \Rightarrow\left(w_{i}+\epsilon\right)-c\left(t_{i}, \theta_{i}\right) \geq\left(w_{j}+\epsilon\right)-c\left(t_{j}, \theta_{i}\right)
$$
For $\epsilon$ arbitrarily small, the firm's profit will be sufficiently close to $\Pi$.

This implies that $\Pi \leq 0$, but note that not offering any contract guarantees zero profit.

【Lemma (13.D.2)】No pooling equilibria exist.

##### Proof:

suppose that firm $j$ is offering contract $\left(w_{p}, t_{p}\right)$

Then firm $k \neq j$ can profitably deviate by offering $(\tilde{w}, \tilde{t}),$ where $\tilde{w}<\theta_{H}$

This contract will attract all type $\theta_{H}$ workers and none of type $\theta_{L}$, who prefer $\left(w_{p}, t_{p}\right)$ to $(\tilde{w}, \tilde{t})$

Furthermore, $\tilde{w}<\theta_{H}$ implies strictly positive profits.

【Lemma (13.D.3)】If $\left(w_{L}, t_{L}\right)$ and $\left(w_{H}, t_{H}\right)$ are the contracts signed by the low- and high-ability workers in a separating equilibrium, then (for each firm) both contracts yield zero profits; that is, $w_{L}=\theta_{L}$ and $w_{H}=\theta_{H}$

##### Proof: 

Suppose first that $w_{L}<\theta_{L}$. 

- Then either firm could earn strictly positive profits by instead offering only contract $\left(\tilde{w}_{L}, t_{L}\right),$ where $\theta_{L}>\tilde{w}_{L}>w_{L}$

- All low-ability workers would accept this contract.

- The deviating firm earns strictly positive profits from any worker (of low or high ability) who accepts it.
- The above lemma says this is impossible. So, we must have $w_{L} \geq \theta_{L}$ in any separating equilibrium. But, $w_{L}>\theta_{L}$ will result in a profit loss.

Next, suppose that $w_{H}<\theta_{H}$. 

- The fact that we have a separating equilibrium implies that $w_{L}$ must lie in the shaded region in the next figure
    (each type $\theta_{H}, \theta_{L}$ prefers the contract designed for him/her to the contract of the other type.)
- suppose firm $j$ is offering $\left(w_{L}, t_{L}\right)$ in the next figure.
- Then, firm $k \neq j$ could earn strictly positive profits by deviating and offering only a contract such as $(\tilde{w}, \tilde{t})$
- This implies we must have $w_{H} \geq \theta_{H} .$ But, $w_{H}>\theta_{H}$ will result in a profit loss.

Breaking even further implies that $w_{L}=\theta_{L}$ and $w_{H}=\theta_{H}$

We then identify properties of contracts in any separating equilibrium:

【Proposition】In any subgame perfect Nash equilibrium of the screening game, low-ability workers accept contract $\left(\theta_{L}, 0\right),$ and high-ability workers accept contract $\left(\theta_{H}, \hat{t}_{H}\right),$ where $\hat{t}_{H}$ satisfies $\theta_{H}-c\left(\hat{t}_{H}, \theta_{L}\right)=\theta_{L}-c\left(0, \theta_{L}\right)$

##### Proof:

If the low-ability is offered a contract with $t_{L}^{\prime}>0$, then one firm can make strictly positive payoff by offering a contract with a lower. 

So we know $\left(w_{L}, t_{L}\right)=\left(\theta_{L}, 0\right)$ and that $w_{H}=\theta_{H}$

Note that low-ability workers are indifferent between contracts $\left(\theta_{L}, 0\right)$ and $\left(\theta_{H}, \hat{t}_{H}\right),$ and  so $\theta_{H}-c\left(\hat{t}_{H}, \theta_{L}\right)=\theta_{L}-c\left(0, \theta_{L}\right)$

Suppose that the high-ability contract $\left(\theta_{H}, t_{H}\right)$ has $t_{H}>\hat{t}_{H}$
. Then, there is a profitable deviation.
