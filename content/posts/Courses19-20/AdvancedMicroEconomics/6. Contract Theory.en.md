Moral hazard: **the principal-agent problem** (MWG 14.B, JR 8.2) 

Monopolistic screening (MWG 14.C) 

- Different from the labor market competitive screening model (MWG 13.D, multiple firms), in the monopolistic screening model we have a monopolistic employer.

## 6.1 Moral Hazard Problem

**Moral hazard models** hidden action, where **asymmetric information forms after the parties enter into a relationship**. 

Consider that a firm/employer/dean (the principal) hires a worker/manager/professor (the agent) to work on a project, which succeeds with some probability if the worker/manager/professor exerts effort. 

If the firm only observes the outcome of the project but not the agent’s effort level. In such a situation, **the firm’s payment contract can only depend on the outcome**, which is an imperfect indicator of the worker’s effort level. 

If the worker is paid fixed wage or if the payment conditional on success is not high enough, since effort is costly, the worker will shirk – moral hazard arises.

### 6.1.1 Setup

Time Structure

- Principal offers a contract.
- Agent decides to accept or reject the contract.
- Upon acceptance, the agent exerts a non-observable effort level e.
- Nature determines how effort transforms into principal’s profit.

The agent selects an effort level $e \in \mathbb{R}_{+}$

Profits $\pi \in[\underline{\pi}, \bar{\pi}]$ are affected by effort $e$, as follows

$$
f(\pi | e)>0, \forall e>0
$$

which indicates that a given profit value $\pi$ can arise from any effort level $e$.

- e.g. a million dollars in profit can arise from a high effort (with a higher conditional probability, but it can also arise from a low effort level (which means the agent is really lucky.. and it occurs with a lower conditional probability)

For simplicity, we restrict the effort level to be binary $e \in\left\{e_{L}, e_{H}\right\}$.

How to make sure there is a conflict between principal's and agent's interest?

- Assuming that a high effort is more likely to yield a high profit than a low effort does 

- The principal seeks to induce a high effort, while the agent would prefer a low effort (if he receive the same salary, to shirk as much as possible)

How should we put this assumption more formally?

we would like to use the notion of First Order Stochastic Dominance (FOSD).
$$
\begin{aligned}
F\left(\pi | e_{H}\right)&<F\left(\pi | e_{L}\right) \text { for all profits } \pi \in[\pi, \bar{\pi}] \\
\text{or } 1-F\left(\pi | e_{H}\right) &> 1-F\left(\pi | e_{L}\right) \text { for all profits } \pi \in[\pi, \bar{\pi}]
\end{aligned}
$$

that is, the probability that $e_{H}$ induces profits equal to $\pi$ or higher is larger than that of $e_{L}$

??? Note that by MWG Proposition 6.D.1 (from Adv Micro 1), the above condition (FOSD) is equivalent to: 

$$
\int \pi \cdot f\left(\pi | \boldsymbol{e}_{H}\right) d \pi>\int \pi \cdot f\left(\pi | e_{L}\right) d \pi
$$

which, in words, says that the expected profits the principal obtains from inducing a high effort are larger than from inducing a low effort.

Agent's payoff

- His Bernoulli utility function is $u(w, e)=v(w)-g(e),$ where $v(w)$ represents his utility from the salary he receives, and $g(e)$ represents his dis-utility from exerting effort e
- We assume $v^{\prime}(w)>0, v^{\prime \prime}(w) \leq 0$ (risk averse), and $g\left(e_{H}\right)>g\left(e_{l}\right)$
- This entails that the agent is risk-averse.

Principal's payoff

- Her Bernoulli utility function is $\pi-w$
- Thus, the principal is risk-neutral
- Exercise: risk-averse principal (MWG 14.B.2).

### 6.1.2 Benchmark: Effort is Observable

The principal must offer at least a reservation utility level $\bar{u}$ to the agent.

In particular, the principal's problem is
$$
\begin{array}{cl}
\max _{w(\pi)} & \int \left(\pi-w(\pi)\right) \cdot f(\pi | e) d \pi \\
\text { s.t. } & \int v(w(\pi)) \cdot f(\pi | e) d \pi-g(e) \geq \bar{u}
\end{array}
$$
Re-arrange terms,
$$
\int(\pi-w(\pi)) \cdot f(\pi | e) d \pi=\int \pi \cdot f(\pi | e) d \pi-\int w(\pi) \cdot f(\pi | e) d \pi
$$

Then, for a given effort $e$, the above maximization problem is equivalent to the following minimization problem

$$
\begin{array}{cl}
\min _{w(\pi)} & \int w(\pi) \cdot f(\pi | e) d \pi \\
\text { s.t.} & \int v(w(\pi)) \cdot f(\pi | e) d \pi-g(e) \geq \bar{u}
\end{array}
$$
Form the Lagrangian function and take first-order condition with respect to $w$ (given each level of $\pi$, and each $e \in\left\{e_{L}, e_{H}\right\}$ ) yields:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&-f(\pi | e)+\gamma \cdot v^{\prime}(w(\pi)) \cdot f(\pi | e)=0 \\
\Rightarrow \quad & f(\pi | e) \cdot\left[\gamma \cdot V^{\prime}(w(\pi))-1\right]=0 \\
\Rightarrow \quad & \frac{1}{v^{\prime}(w(\pi))}=\gamma
\end{aligned}
$$

with $v^{\prime}(w)>0$, we have $\gamma>0$, it means that the constraint is binding.

$v^{\prime}(w(\pi))$ is decreasing in $w,$ because $v^{\prime \prime}(w)<0 .$ Therefore, $\frac{1}{v^{\prime}(w(x))}$ is increasing in $w$.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200518114148.png)

The principal thus provides a "fixed" wage payment $(w(\pi)$ does not change with $\pi$ ) that solves $\frac{1}{v^{\prime}(w(\pi))}=\gamma$

- Intuition: A risk-sharing arrangement. the risk-neutral principal offers a contract to the risk-averse agent that guarantees him a fixed payoff $w_{e}^{*}$ (which is still a function of the effort he exerts, because effort is observable in this context), and is not affected by the profit level $\pi$.

Hence, the principal offers the minimum salary $w_{e}^{*}$ that guarantees agent's acceptance of the contract:

$$
v\left(w_{e}^{*}\right)-g(e)=\bar{u} \Leftrightarrow w_{e}^{*}=v^{-1}(\bar{u}+g(e))
$$

for each effort level $e \in\left\{e_{L}, e_{H}\right\} .$ Notationally, instead of writing $\int v(w(\pi)) \cdot f(\pi | e) d \pi,$ we write $v\left(w_{e}^{*}\right)$ since the principal pays the same salary $w_{e}^{*}$ for all profit levels.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200518115424.png)

In addition, since $g\left(e_{H}\right)>g\left(e_{L}\right),$ we have
$$
w_{e_{H}}^{*}=v^{-1}\left(\bar{u}+g\left(e_{H}\right)\right)>w_{e_{L}}^{*}=v^{-1}\left(\bar{u}+g\left(e_{L}\right)\right)
$$

that is, the salary inducing a high effort level should be larger than that inducing a low effort level.

A numerical exercise: $v(w)=\sqrt{w}, g(e)=e^{3}, \bar{u}=10$

- Derive the optimal wages that induce $e_{L}, e_{H},$ respectively.
- How does the principal's expected payoff depends on the effort levels?

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200518122116.png)

#### Question: which effort level maximizes the principal's expected payoff?

Insert the expression of $w_{i}$ where $e \in\left\{e_{l}, e_{H}\right\}$ into the principal's payoff function:
$$
\underbrace{\int \pi \cdot f(\pi | e) d \pi}_{\text {Expected profit at each effort level }}-\underbrace{v^{-1}(\bar{u}+g(e))}_{w_{e}^{*} \text { for each effort level }}
$$
the expression represents the expected profit tor the principal minus the fixed salary she has to pay.

$e_{H}$ or $e_{L} ?$ It depends. If $e_{H}$ increases the expected profits by a larger extent than the increase in the salary, then it is better for the principal to induce $e_{H}$. Otherwise, it is better for her to induce $e_{L}$.

### 6.1.3 Main Model: Effort is Not Observable

In the moral hazard setting where effort $ e $ is not observable, the principal's contract need to ensure that the agent has sufficient incentives to choose the effort level in equilibrium. In particular,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min _{w(\pi)} & \int w(\pi) \cdot f(\pi | e) d \pi \\
\text { s.t.} & \int v(w(\pi)) \cdot f(\pi | e) d \pi-g(e) \geq \bar{u} \quad \text{(P.C.)}\\
\text { e solves } & \max _{\tilde{e} \in \{e_L, e_H\}} \int v(w(\pi)) \cdot f(\pi | \tilde{e}) d \pi-g(\tilde{e}) \quad \text{(I.C.)}
\end{aligned}
$$
where P.C. denotes the **participation constraint condition**, and I.C. denotes the **incentive compatibility condition**.

- In the following analysis, we will first try to get rid of some of the constraints by understanding which salary will induce $ e_{L} $ and which salary will induce $e_{H}$.

#### What if the principal wishes to choose a salary to induce effort level $e_{L}$ ?

- To offer the agent fixed wage payment ("fixed" with respect to profit levels $\pi$)

$$
w_{e_{L}}^{*}=v^{-1}\left(\bar{u}+g\left(e_{L}\right)\right)
$$

- Check the PC constraint: the agent shall have utility level exactly $\bar{u}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \int v\left(w_{e_{L}}^{*}\right) \cdot f\left(\pi | {e}_{L}\right) d \pi-g\left(e_{L}\right) \\
=& v\left(v^{-1}\left(\bar{u}+g\left({e}_{L}\right)\right)\right) \cdot \int f\left(\pi | {e}_{L}\right) d \pi-g\left(e_{L}\right)=\bar{u}
\end{aligned}
$$

- Then check the IC constraint: the salary would not induce the alternative effort level $e_H$ because $g(e_H) > g(e_L)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\quad \int v\left(w_{e_{L}}^{*}\right) \cdot f\left(\pi | e_{H}\right) d \pi-g\left(e_{H}\right) \\
=&\quad\left(\bar{u}+g\left(e_{L}\right)\right) \cdot \int f\left(\pi | \theta_{H}\right) d \pi-g\left(e_{H}\right) \\
=&\quad \bar{u}+g\left(e_{L}\right)-g\left(e_{H}\right) \\
<&\quad \bar{u}=\int v\left(w_{e_L}^*\right) \cdot f\left(\pi | e_{L}\right) d \pi-g\left(e_{L}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

- Intuitively, the wage $w_{e_L}^*$ is fixed with respect to $\pi$, thus it is also unaffected by agents effort level. So the agent will choose the effort level $e$ that involves the lowest disutility.

- Note that this salary $w_{\dot{e}_{2}}^{*}=v^{-1}\left(\bar{u}+g\left(e_{L}\right)\right)$ coincides with the salary we found when effort is observable.
- It satisfies P.C.-L binding and makes I.C.-L slack.
- It minimizes the salary expenses from the principal to the agent: if there were a higher salary, then it could still be reduced to induce the agent to participate with effort level $e_{L}$, where as if the salary were lower, then it would deter the agent from participating, and the agent would just refuse to sign the contract.

#### Then, what is the salary to induce effort level $e_{H}$ ?

Note that, the agent will choose effort $e_{H}$ rather than $e_{L}$ if his Incentive Compatibility condition (I.C.-H) holds:

$$
\underbrace{\int v(w(\pi)) \cdot f\left(\pi | e_{H}\right) d \pi-g\left(e_{H}\right)}_{\text {Salar minus disutility of high effort }} \geq \underbrace{\int v(w(\pi)) \cdot f\left(\pi | e_{L}\right) d \pi-g\left(e_{L}\right)}_{\text {Salary minus disutility of low effort }}
$$
Hence, the principal's optimization problem, when she seeks to induce $e_{H}$ from the agent, becomes

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min _{w(\pi)} &\int w(\pi) \cdot f\left(\pi | e_{H}\right) d \pi \\
\text { s.t. } &\int v(w(\pi)) \cdot f\left(\pi | e_{H}\right) d \pi-g\left(e_{H}\right) \geq \bar{U} \quad(P . C .-H) \\
&\int v(w(\pi)) \cdot f\left(\pi | e_{H}\right) d \pi-g\left(e_{H}\right) \geq \int v(w(\pi)) \cdot f\left(\pi | e_{L}\right) d \pi-g\left(e_{L}\right) \quad(I . C .-H)
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $\gamma$ and $\mu$ be the Lagrangian multipliers of constraints P.C.-H and I.C.-H, respectively. Take the first order condition with respect to $w$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\quad-f\left(\pi | e_{H}\right)+\gamma \cdot v^{\prime}(w(\pi)) \cdot f\left(\pi | e_{H}\right) \\
+\quad \mu \cdot v^{\prime}(w(\pi)) \cdot f\left(\pi | e_{H}\right)-\mu \cdot v^{\prime}(w(\pi)) \cdot f\left(\pi | \theta_{L}\right)=0
\end{array}
$$

Re-arrange terms, we have

$$
\frac{1}{v^{\prime}(w(\pi))}=\gamma+\underbrace{\mu \cdot\left[1-\frac{f\left(\pi | e_{L}\right)}{f\left(\pi | e_{H}\right)}\right]}_{\text {New stuff compared to the Benchmark }}
$$
Both constraints are binding, i.e. $\gamma>0$ and $\mu>0 .$ Otherwise:

- If $\gamma=0$, because the $F\left(\pi | e_{H}\right)$ FOSD $F\left(\pi | e_{L}\right)$, there must exist an open set of profits $\tilde{\Pi} \subset[\pi, \bar{\pi}]$ such that $\frac{f\left(\pi | e_{L}\right)}{f\left(\pi | e_{H}\right)}>1$ for all $\pi \in \tilde{\Pi}$. since $v^{\prime}(w(\pi))>0$, a contradiction.
- If $\mu=0,$ the condition implies that the optimal salary schedule is a fixed payment, not changing with $\pi$. But given a fixed payment, the agent would rather choose $e_{L}$, not $e_{H}$. A contradiction.

Comparing the above first-order condition with the benchmark model, to induce $e_H$:

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200518170956.png)

Note that $\gamma$ is the same multiplier attach to the same constraint of that optimization problem (consider the meaning of Lagrange multiplier). So the two first order conditions are comparable:

$$
\frac{1}{v^{\prime}(w(\pi))}=\gamma+\mu \cdot\left[1-\frac{f\left(\pi | e_{L}\right)}{f\left(\pi | e_{H}\right)}\right] \quad ? \quad \underbrace{\frac{1}{v^{\prime}(w(\pi))}=\gamma}_{\text {fom which we get } w_{e_H}^*}
$$

Therefore, for those $\pi$ such that

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text { If } \frac{f\left(\pi | e_{L}\right)}{f\left(\pi | e_{H}\right)}>1, \text { we have } w(\pi)<w_{e_{H}}^{*}\\
&\text { If } \frac{f\left(\pi | e_{L}\right)}{f\left(\pi | e_{H}\right)}<1, \text { we have } w(\pi)>w_{e_{H}}^{*}
\end{aligned}
$$

The second condition, the likelihood ratio being smaller than 1 , is called Monotone Likelihood Ratio Property.

##### Monotone Likelihood Ration Property

Under which conditions is the optimal wage scheme $w$ monotonically increasing in profits $\pi$ ?

- For that, we need the likelihood ratio $\frac{f\left(\pi | e_{L}\right)}{f\left(\pi | e_{H}\right)}$ ) to be decreasing in profits.
- i.e. as profits increase the likelihood of obtaining profit $\pi$ from $e_{H}$ must increase faster than that from $e_{L}$

【Monotone Likelihood Ratio Property】 The conditional density functions $\{f(| e)\}_{e \in\{a, \theta\}\}}$ satisfy (strict) Monotone Likelihood Ratio Property if for every $\pi>\pi$ and $e_{H}>e_{l},$ we have

$$
\frac{f\left(\pi | {e}_{L}\right)}{f\left(\pi | {e}_{H}\right)}<\frac{f\left(\tilde{\pi} | {e}_{L}\right)}{f\left(\tilde{\pi} | {e}_{\boldsymbol{H}}\right)}
$$

When MLRP holds, the salary is increasing in profits, i.e. $w(\pi_2) > w(\pi_1)$.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200518173305.png)

Does the assumption FOSD imply (or conflict with) the Monotone Likelihood Ratio Property? 

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200518173128.png)

Ans: Not necessarily. (And this is why the argument for $\gamma >0$ is valid.)

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200518163431.png)

Optimal wage scheme $w(\pi)$ is increasing in $\pi$ only when MLRP holds, i.e. $\frac{f\left(\pi | e_{L}\right)}{f\left(\pi | e_{H}\right)}$ be decreasing in $\pi$ (or the distance $\left|f\left(\pi | e_{H}\right)-f\left(\pi | e_{L}\right)\right|$ grows).

So in the example, it only occurs for profits $\pi \in\left[\pi_{0}, \pi_{2}\right]$ (and in the picture maybe also for some part a little bit below $\pi_{0}$ ).

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200518173537.png)

Given the above salary schedule to induce $e_{H}$ and $e_{L}$, which effort level does the principal prefer?

- The fixed payment salary $w_{e_{L}}^{*}=v^{-1}\left(\bar{u}+g\left(e_{L}\right)\right)$ will induce $e_{L},$ which is the same as the benchmark model.

- In order to induce high effort $e_H$, given the fact that the agent is risk-averse the salary $w(\pi)$ needs to be higher than the fixed payment salary $w_{e_{H}}^{*}=v^{-1}\left(\bar{u}+g\left(e_{H}\right)\right)$ under the benchmark model. The agent needs to be compensated for the risk he bears.

Hence, when deciding which effort level to induce, the principal compares two effects

- On one hand, $e_H$ will increase the likelihood of higher profits
- On the other hand, it will only happen if the agent is paid a higher than $w_{e_H}^*$ salary.
- The risk-premium that the principal must now offer the agent makes $e_{H}$ more costly to be induced. Thus, $e_H$ is less likely to arise as optimal for the principal when effort is not observable than when effort is observable (the benchmark)

## 6.2 Monopolistic Screening (Hidden Information Model)

Potential employer(s) have incomplete information regarding the types (e.g. high-ability or low-ability) of workers.

Hidden information with more-than-one employers

- The labor market competitive screening model. (MWG 13.C)
- Multiple firms offering different contracts (w; t) to workers of different types.

Hidden information with one employer (“Principal”)

- Monopolistic screening model. (MWG 14.C)
- A single firm offering different contracts (w, t) to workers of different types.

### 6.2.1 Model Setup

We still consider a setting with asymmetric information between a principal and an agent.

However, the effort is now perfectly observable. What is unobservable in this model?

We shall consider the unobservable element be the disutility/cost $ g(e) $ that the agent experiences from exerting effort .

The principal's payoff: $\pi(e)-w$

- Where profits $\pi(e)$ are increasing, but at a decreasing rate, in effort; i.e. $\pi^{\prime}(e)>0$ and $\pi^{\prime \prime}(e)<0$

- No profit arises if the agent exerts no effort; i.e. $\pi(0)=0$

- The principal is risk-neutral.
- Indifference curve illustration: The principal is better off if salary is lower given an effort level, or if effort is higher given a profit level.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200518175013.png)

The agent's payoff: $u(w, e, \theta)=v(w-g(e, \theta))$

- $g(e, \theta)$ measures the disutility from effort, and $g(0, \theta) = 0$.
- $g_{e}(e, \theta) \geq 0, g_{e}(0, \theta)=0,$ and $g_{e e}(e, \theta)>0 ;$ i.e. the disutility is increasing and convex in effort.
- $g_{\theta}(e, \theta)<0 ;$ i.e. given an effort, the disutility is lower for higher type.
- $g_{e \theta}(e, \theta) \leq 0 ;$ i.e. the marginal disutility is lower for higher type.
- In addition, $v^{\prime}>0$ and $v^{\prime \prime}<0,$ which implies that the agent is risk-averse.

For simplicity, we consider binary types $\Theta=\left\{\theta_{H}, \theta_{L}\right\}$ with probability $p$ and $1-p$

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200518180130.png)

The difference curve is totally depend on $g(\cdot)$. The agent is better off for higher salary (if fix the effort), or for lower effort (if fix the salary).

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200518180250.png)

The slope of the agent's two types' indifference curves:

- since $g_{e \theta}(e, \theta)<0$, the marginal disutility of effort satisfies $g_{e}\left(e, \theta_{L}\right)>g_{e}\left(e, \theta_{H}\right) .$ So the high type's indifference curve is flatter.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200518190353.png)

### 6.2.2 Benchmark: Observable $g(\cdot)$

In the benchmark model, a contract specifies the salary as a function of both the effort and type $\theta$ (both are observable).

That is, a salary-effort pair $(w_{H}, e_{H})$ for type $\theta_{H}$, and another pair $\left(w_{l}, e_{l}\right)$ for type $\theta_{L}$.

Consider maximizing the ex-ante payoffs, the principal's problem is
$$
\begin{aligned}
\max _{w_{L}, e_{L}, w_{H}, e_{H}} &p \cdot\left[\pi\left(e_{H}\right)-w_{H}\right]+(1-p) \cdot\left[\pi\left(\theta_{L}\right)-w_{L}\right] \\
\text { s.t. } &p v\left(w_{H}-g\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)\right)+(1-p) v\left(w_{L}-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right)\right) \geq \bar{u} \quad (P.C.)
\end{aligned}
$$

Let the Lagrangian multiplier to the P.C. be $\gamma$. 

Exercise: Note that, if we instead consider the interim payoff; i.e. the agents P.C. after knowing his type we can write the above P.C. into two conditions and use Lagrangian multiplier $\gamma_{1}, \gamma_{2}$ for each constraint (**the solution is the same**)

First order conditions are:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\partial w_{H}:& \quad-p+\gamma \cdot p \cdot v^{\prime}\left(w_{H}^{*}-g\left(e_{H}^{*}, \theta_{H}\right)\right)=0 \\
\partial w_{L}:& \quad-(1-p)+\gamma \cdot(1-p) \cdot v^{\prime}\left(w_{L}^{*}-g\left(e_{L}^{*}, \theta_{L}\right)\right)=0\\
\partial e_{H}:& \quad p \cdot \pi^{\prime}\left(e_{H}^{*}\right)-\gamma \cdot p \cdot v^{\prime}\left(w_{H}^{*}-g\left(e_{H}^{*}, \theta_{H}\right)\right) \cdot g_{e}\left(e_{H}^{*}, \theta_{H}\right)=0 \\
\partial \theta_{L}:& \quad(1-p) \cdot \pi^{\prime}\left(e_{L}^{*}\right)-\gamma \cdot(1-p) \cdot v^{\prime}\left(w_{L}^{*}-g\left(e_{L}^{*}, \theta_{L}\right)\right) \cdot g_{e}\left(e_{L}^{*}, \theta_{L}\right)=0
\end{aligned}
$$
Note that if we had written the P.C. into two constraints, it is just a re-scaling of the multiplier; i.e. $\gamma_{1}=\gamma p$ and $\gamma_{2}=\gamma(1-p)$.

Salaries $w_{\mu}^{*}$ and $w_{i}^{*}$ are positive

- To guarantee acceptance under observability; i.e. $w_{i}^{*}=v^{-1}(\bar{u})+g\left(e_{i}, \theta_{i}\right), i=H, L$ only if $w_{i}^{*}>0$.

Effort level $e_H^*$ and $e_L^*$ are positive

- Suppose otherwise; i.e. $e_{H}=0 .$ The 3rd FOC becomes

$$
p \cdot \underbrace{ \pi ^{\prime}(0)}_{>0}-\gamma \cdot p \cdot v^{\prime}\left(w_{H}^{*}-g\left(0, \theta_{H}\right)\right) \cdot \underbrace{g_{e}\left(0, \theta_{H}\right)}_{=0}=p \cdot \pi^{\prime}(0)>0
$$

- which indicates that the principal's marginal payoff can be further improved by increasing $e_H$ from zero to a positive amount. Similar argument applies to $e_{H}>0$

Solving for $\gamma$ in the first two FOCs and re-arrange terms:
$$
v^{\prime}\left(w_{H}^{*}-g\left(e_{\mu}^{*}, \theta_{H}\right)\right)=v^{\prime}\left(w_{L}^{*}-g\left(e_{L}^{*}, \theta_{L}\right)\right)
$$

because $v(\cdot)$ is a monotone increasing function, the above also implies

$$
w_{н}^{*}-g\left(e_{Н}^{*}, \theta_{H}\right)=w_{L}^{*}-g\left(e_{L}^{*}, \theta_{L}\right)
$$

which further implies the utility also equals

$$
v\left(w_{H}^{*}-g\left(e_{H}^{*}, \theta_{H}\right)\right)=v\left(w_{L}^{*}-g\left(e_{L}^{*}, \theta_{L}\right)\right)
$$

Therefore, the risk averse agent obtains the same marginal utility, payoff, and total utility for both types.

When the principal's payoff maximizes, P.C. must be binding (otherwise there will be room for more profit by principal):

$$
p v\left(w_{H}^{*}-g\left(e_{H}^{*}, \theta_{H}\right)\right)+(1-p) v\left(w_{L}^{*}-g\left(e_{L}^{*}, \theta_{L}\right)\right)=\bar{u}
$$

Since $v\left(w_{H}^{*}-g\left(e_{H}^{*}, \theta_{H}\right)\right)=v\left(w_{L}^{*}-g\left(e_{L}^{*}, \theta_{L}\right)\right),$ the P.C. becomes

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\quad p v\left(w_{H}^{*}-g\left(e_{H}^{*}, \theta_{H}\right)\right)+(1-p) v\left(w_{H}^{*}-g\left(e_{H}^{*}, \theta_{H}\right)\right)=\bar{u} \\
\Rightarrow &\quad v\left(w_{H}^{*}-g\left(e_{H}^{*}, \theta_{H}\right)\right)=\bar{u}
\end{aligned}
$$

So the optimal salaries satisfy $w_{i}^{*}=v^{-1}(\bar{u})+g\left(e_{i}^{*}, \theta_{i}\right), i=H, L$.

Now we check the other two FOCs and look for the optimal effort level. Combining the **third/fourth FOC with the first/second FOC**, we have
$$
\pi^{\prime}\left(e_{H}^{*}\right)=g_{e}\left(e_{H}^{*}, \theta_{H}\right), \pi^{\prime}\left(e_{L}^{*}\right)=g_{e}\left(e_{L}^{*}, \theta_{L}\right)

Intuitively, for each type, principal's payoff is maximized when the marginal profit equals marginal disutility. An illustration.

Optimal wage-effort pair $\left(w_{i}^{*}, e_{i}^{*}\right), \forall i=H, L$ is represented by the tangency of the agent's and the principal's indifference curves.

### 6.2.3 Main Model: Unobservable $ g(\cdot) $

When only the agent observes the true type $\theta_{i}$ while the principal does not, would the agent have incentive to truthfully reveal the type information to the principal and then choose the contract accordingly?

Or alternatively, can the principal still offer the same contracts $\left(w_{H}^{*}, e_{H}^{*}\right)$ and $\left(w_{L}^{*}, e_{L}^{*}\right)$ and let the agent to self-select them into different contracts?

The answer is no. In the previous figure, type $\theta_{H}$ agent will have incentive to lie to say that his type is $\theta_{L}$, because the pair $w_{L}^{*}, e_{L}^{*}$ lies above his current indifference curve, which means if he lies, he can achieve a higher utility.

Offering a high type a $\left(w_{L}^{*}, \theta_{L}^{*}\right)$ certainly reduces the principal's profits.

Given this problem, what should the optimal contract be under unobservable types?

In particular, the principal chooses contract $\left(w_{H}, e_{H}\right)$ and $\left(w_{L}, e_{L}\right)$ to solve the maximization problem:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\max _{w_{L}, e_{L}, w_{H}, e_{H}} &p \cdot\left[\pi\left(e_{H}\right)-w_{H}\right]+(1-p) \cdot\left[\pi\left(e_{L}\right)-w_{L}\right] \\
\text { s.t. } &v\left(w_{H}-g\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)\right) \geq \bar{u} \quad(P . C .-H) \\
\quad &v\left(w_{L}-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right)\right) \geq \bar{u} \quad(P . C .-L) \\
\quad &v\left(w_{H}-g\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)\right) \geq v\left(w_{L}-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{H}\right)\right) \quad(lI. C .-H) \\
\quad &v\left(w_{L}-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right)\right) \geq v\left(w_{H}-g\left(e_{H}, \theta_{L}\right)\right) \quad(I . C .-L)
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the P.C. conditions can be re-arranged as
$$
w_{i}-g\left(e_{i}, \theta_{i}\right) \geq v^{-1}(\bar{u}), i=H, L
$$
The I.C. conditions can also be re-arranged as:
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\underbrace{w_{H}-g\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)}_{\text {High type chooses his contract }} \geq \underbrace{w_{L}-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{H}\right)}_{\text {High type chooses low type's contract }}  (I . C .-H)\\
\underbrace{w_{L}-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right)}_{\text {Low type chooses his contract }} \geq \underbrace{w_{H}-g\left(e_{H}, \theta_{L}\right)}_{\text {Low type chooses high type's contract }} (I . C .-H)
\end{array}
$$
The I.C. conditions ensures that the agents are truth-telling and self-select themselves into the designated contract.

#### Four steps to solve the principal's maximization problem

**1st Step**: Simplify the constraints. P.C.-H is satisfied when all other constraints hold	
$$
\begin{aligned}
w_{H}-g\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right) & \geq w_{L}-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{H}\right) \quad(I . C .-H) \\
& \geq w_{L}-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right) \geq v^{-1}(\bar{u}) \quad(P . C .-L)
\end{aligned}
$$

since $g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{H}\right)<g\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)$. The last inequality implies that (P.C.-H) must hold.

Therefore, the principal's maximization problem reduces to:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\max _{w_{L}, e_{L}, w_{H}, e_{H}} &p \cdot\left[\pi\left(e_{H}\right)-w_{H}\right]+(1-p) \cdot\left[\pi\left(e_{L}\right)-w_{L}\right] \\
\text { s.t. } &w_{L}-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right) \geq v^{-1}(\bar{u}) & (P . C .-L) \\
&w_{H}-g\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right) \geq w_{L}-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{H}\right) & (I . C .-H) \\
&w_{L}-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right) \geq w_{H}-g\left(e_{H}, \theta_{L}\right) & (I . C .-L)
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $\gamma, \phi_{H}, \phi_{L}$ be the Lagrangian multiplier for the three constraints. **Kuhn-Tucker conditions** are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\partial w_{H}: & \quad-p+\phi_{H}-\phi_{L}=0 \quad &(1) \\
\partial w_{L}: & \quad -(1-p)+\gamma-\phi_{H}+\phi_{L}=0 \quad &(2)  \\
\partial e_{H}: & \quad p \pi^{\prime}\left(e_{H}\right)-\phi_{H} g_{e}\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)+\phi_{L} g_{e}\left(e_{H}, \theta_{L}\right)=0 \quad &(3) \\
\partial e_{L}: & \quad (1-p) \pi^{\prime}\left(e_{L}\right)-\left(\gamma+\phi_{L}\right) g_{e}\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right)+\phi_{H} g_{e}\left(\theta_{L}, \theta_{H}\right)=0 \quad &(4)
\end{aligned}
$$

Condition (1) can be written as $\phi_{H}=p+\phi_{L},$ which implies $\phi_{H}>0$

Therefore, I.C.-H must be binding; i.e. 
$$
w_{H}-g\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)=w_{L}-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{H}\right)
$$

**2nd Step**: Adding up (1) and (2):
$$
\left(-p+\phi_{H}-\phi_{L}\right)+\left(-(1-p)+\gamma-\phi_{H}+\phi_{L}\right)=0
$$

which implies $\gamma=1>0 .$ So (P.C.-L) must be binding
$$
w_{L}=v^{-1}(\bar{u})+g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right)
$$

**3rd Step**: The fact that Lagrangian multipliers $\phi_{H}>0$ and $\gamma>0$ implies $\phi_{L}=0$

**Proof:** 

Suppose not; i.e. $\phi_{L}>0,$ which implies that (I.C.-L) is binding. We can then derive a contradiction as follows:

First, substitute for $\phi_{H}$ in condition (3) using $\phi_{H}=p+\phi_{L}$ we have:
$$
\begin{aligned}
p \pi^{\prime}\left(e_{H}\right)-\left(p+\phi_{L}\right) g_{e}\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)+\phi_{L} g_{e}\left(e_{H}, \theta_{L}\right)=0 \text{  or, } \\
p\underbrace{\left[\pi^{\prime}\left(e_{H}\right)-g_{e}\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)\right]}_{<0 \qquad \Leftarrow}+\phi_{L}[\underbrace{g_{e}\left(e_{H}, \theta_{L}\right)-g_{e}\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)}_{>0}]=0
\end{aligned}
$$

since the marginal cost of exerting $e_{H}$ effort is higher for type $\theta_{L}$ than for type $\theta_{H}$.

Substitute for $\phi_{H}$ using $\phi_{H}=p+\phi_{L}$ and $\gamma=1$ for condition (4):
$$
\begin{array}{l}
(1-p) \pi^{\prime}\left(e_{L}\right)-\left(1+\phi_{L}\right) g_{e}\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right)+\left(p+\phi_{L}\right) g_{e}\left(e_{L}, \theta_{H}\right)=0 \text { ог, } \\
(1-p)[\underbrace{\left.\pi^{\prime}\left(e_{L}\right)-g_{e}\left(e_{L}, \theta_{H}\right)\right]}_{>0 \qquad \Leftarrow}+\left(1+\phi_{L}\right)[\underbrace{g_{e}\left(e_{L}, \theta_{H}\right)-g_{e}\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right)}_{<0}]=0
\end{array}
$$

Since the marginal cost of exerting $e_{L}$ effort is lower for type $\theta_{H}$ than for type $\theta_{L}$.

Therefore, we can summarize the conditions to
$$
\pi^{\prime}\left(e_{L}\right)-g_{e}\left(e_{L}, \theta_{H}\right)>0>\pi^{\prime}\left(e_{H}\right)-g_{e}\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)
$$

Since $\pi^{\prime \prime}(e)<0$ and $g_{e e}\left(e, \theta_{H}\right)>0$, which implies that $\frac{\partial^{2}\left(\pi(e)-g\left(e, \theta_{H}\right)\right)}{\partial \theta^{2}}<0$; i.e. $\pi(e)-g\left(e, \theta_{H}\right)$ is concave in $e$.
Alternatively, its first-order derivative is deceasing in $e$, which implies
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\pi^{\prime}\left(e_{L}\right)-g_{e}\left(e_{L}, \theta_{H}\right)>\pi^{\prime}\left(e_{H}\right)-g_{e}\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right) \\
\Rightarrow \quad &e_{H}>e_{L}
\end{aligned}
$$

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Henrry-Wu/FigBed/Figs/20200519182523.png)

But if $e_{H}>e_{L}$ and $I C_{H}$ is binding (as we have shown $\phi_{H}>0$ ), we know that
$$
w_{H}-g\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)=w_{L}-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{H}\right)
$$

which can be expressed as
$$
w_{H}-w_{L}=g\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{H}\right)=\int_{e_{L}}^{e_{H}} g_{e}\left(e, \theta_{H}\right) d e
$$

Furthermore, $\int_{e_{L}}^{e_{H}} g_{e}\left(e, \theta_{H}\right) d e<\int_{e_{L}}^{e_{H}} g_{e}\left(e, \theta_{L}\right) d e$ since the marginal disutility of effort satisfies $g_{e}\left(e, \theta_{H}\right)<g_{e}\left(e, \theta_{L}\right)$ for all $e$.

Hence, since $\int_{e_{L}}^{e_{H}} g_{e}\left(e, \theta_{L}\right) d e=g\left(e_{H}, \theta_{L}\right)-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right),$ we can re-write the above expression as
$$
w_{H}-w_{L}=g\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{H}\right)<g\left(e_{H}, \theta_{L}\right)-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right)
$$

which entails

$$
w_{H}-g\left(e_{H}, \theta_{L}\right)<w_{L}-g\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right)
$$

which ultimately implies that constraint $I C_{L}$ must be slack (not binding); i.e. $\phi_{L}=0,$ which is out desired contradiction.

**4th Step**: Now condition (1) becomes $\phi_{H}=p .$ Substitute into condition (3) and (4)
$$
\begin{aligned}
\pi^{\prime}\left(e_{H}\right)-g_{e}\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)&=0 \qquad (5)\\
\pi^{\prime}\left(e_{L}\right)-g_{e}\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right)+\frac{p}{1-p}\left[g_{e}\left(e_{L}, \theta_{H}\right)-g_{e}\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right)\right]&=0 \qquad (6)
\end{aligned}
$$

Optimal effort levels $e_{H}$ and $e_{L}$ solve condition (5) and (6).

Optimal wage levels $w_{H}$ and $w_{L}$ solve conditions (P.C.-L) and (I.C.-H) with equalities.

### 6.2.4 Benchmark model vs. Unobservable Types

- The same high effort $e_{H}$ at optimality ; i.e. in both the benchmark and the main model (unobservable types), $e_{H}^{*}$ solves $\pi^{\prime}\left(e_{H}\right)=g_{e}\left(e_{H}, \theta_{H}\right)$

- The optimal $e_{L}$ 's are different in the benchmark and the main model.
    - In the benchmark, $e_{L}^{*}$ solves $\pi^{\prime}\left(e_{L}\right)=g_{e}\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right)$
    - In the main model, optimal $e_{L}$ solves

$$
\underbrace{\pi^{\prime}\left(e_{L}\right)-g_{e}\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right)}_{>0}+\frac{p}{1-p}[\underbrace{g_{e}\left(e_{L}, \theta_{H}\right)-g_{e}\left(e_{L}, \theta_{L}\right)}_{<0}]=0
$$

- The first term is positive for all $e_{L}<e_{L}^{*},$ and the second term is always negative. Thus, we must have $e_{L}<e_{L}^{*}$ for this equation to hold.
