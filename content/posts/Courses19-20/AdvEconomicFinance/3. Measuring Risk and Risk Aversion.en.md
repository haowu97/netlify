# 3. Measuring Risk and Risk Aversion

### 3.1 Measuring Risk Aversion

If U[E(W )] < E[U(W )] or the utility function is strictly convex, then the individual is a risk lover; 

If U[E(W )] = E[U(W )] or the utility function is linear, then the individual is risk neutral; 

If U[E(W )] > E[U(W )] or the utility function is strictly concave, then the individual is risk averse;

#### coeffcient of  risk aversion & Probability premium

coeffcient of absolute risk aversion 
$$
R_{A}(Y)=-\frac{u^{\prime \prime}(Y)}{u^{\prime}(Y)}
$$
coeffcient of relative risk aversion
$$
R_{R}(Y)=-\frac{Y u^{\prime \prime}(Y)}{u^{\prime}(Y)}
$$
To interpret the two measures of risk aversion, it is helpful to recall from calculus the theorem stated by Brook Taylor (England, $1685-1731$ ), regarding the approximation of a function $f$ using its derivatives: the "first-order" approximation
$$
f(x+a)=f(x)+f^{\prime}(x) a+o(a)
$$
and the "second-order" approximation
$$
f(x+a)=f(x)+f^{\prime}(x) a+\frac{1}{2} f^{\prime \prime}(x) a^{2}+o\left(a^{2}\right)
$$

注意上述等式与**概率溢价**的联系

Probability premium $\pi(w, \epsilon, u)$
$$
L=(0.5+\pi \circ w+\epsilon, 0.5-\pi \circ w-\epsilon)
$$
Find the $\pi$ to make $C E(L)=w,$ that is
$$
\begin{aligned}
& U(L)=u(w)=(0.5+\pi) u(w+\epsilon)+(0.5-\pi) u(w-\epsilon) \\
\Rightarrow \quad & \pi(w, \epsilon ; u)
\end{aligned}
$$

#### 风险溢价(Risk premium)与确定性等价

**Jensen's Inequality** Let $g$ be a concave function and $\tilde{x}$ be a random variable. Then
$$
g[E(\tilde{x})] \geq E[g(\tilde{x})]
$$
Furthermore, if $g$ is strictly concave and the probability that $\tilde{x} \neq E(\tilde{x})$ is greater than zero, the inequality is strict.

An implication of Jensen's inequality is that the maximum riskless payoff that a risk-averse investor is willing to exchange for the asset with random payoff $\tilde{Z}$, called the certainty equivalent for that asset, will always be less than $E(\tilde{Z})$

The difference between the higher expected value $E(\tilde{Z})$ and the

- smaller certainty equivalent $C E(\tilde{Z})$ can then be used to define the positive risk premium $\Pi(\tilde{Z})$ for the asset:

$$
\Pi(\tilde{Z})=E(\tilde{Z})-C E(\tilde{Z})
$$

Mathematically, the **certainty equivalent** $C E(\tilde{Z})$ and **risk premium** $\Pi(\tilde{Z})$ for an asset with random payoff $\tilde{Z}$ with expected value $E(\tilde{Z})$ are defined by
$$
E(u(Y+\tilde{Z}))=u[Y+C E(\tilde{Z})]
$$
"the expected utility from buying the asset equals the utility from getting the certainty equivalent for sure," and
$$
E(u(Y+\tilde{Z}))=u[Y+E(\tilde{Z})-\Pi(\tilde{Z})]
$$

assume for simplicity that $E(\tilde{Z})=0$ and consider a second-order Taylor approximation to $E(u(Y+\tilde{Z}))$
$$
\begin{aligned}
E(u(Y+\tilde{Z})) & \approx E[u(Y)]+E\left[u^{\prime}(Y) \tilde{Z}\right]+E\left[\frac{1}{2} u^{\prime \prime}(Y) \tilde{Z}^{2}\right] \\
&=u(Y)+u^{\prime}(Y) E(\tilde{Z})+\frac{1}{2} u^{\prime \prime}(Y) E\left[\tilde{Z}^{2}\right] \\
&=u(Y)+\frac{1}{2} \sigma_{\tilde{Z}}^{2} u^{\prime \prime}(Y)
\end{aligned}
$$
since $Y$ is not random.

Consider a first-order Taylor approximation to $u[Y+E(\tilde{Z})-\Pi(\tilde{Z})]$
$$
\begin{aligned}
u[Y+E(\tilde{Z})-\Pi(\tilde{Z})] &=u[Y-\Pi(\tilde{Z})] \\
& \approx u(Y)-u^{\prime}(Y) \Pi(\tilde{Z})
\end{aligned}
$$
Hence, with $E(\tilde{Z})=0,$ the equation defining the risk premium $E(u(Y+\tilde{z}))=u[Y+E(\tilde{Z})-\Pi(\tilde{Z})]$
$$
\begin{aligned}
E(u(Y+\tilde{Z})) & \approx u(Y)+\frac{1}{2} \sigma_{\bar{Z}}^{2} u^{\prime \prime}(Y) \\
u[Y+E(\tilde{Z})-\Pi(\tilde{Z})] & \approx u(Y)-u^{\prime}(Y) \Pi(\tilde{Z})
\end{aligned}
$$
imply
$$
\Pi(\tilde{Z}) \approx \frac{1}{2} \sigma_{\bar{Z}}^{2} R_{A}(Y)
$$

under the simplifying assumption that $E(\tilde{Z})=0,$ it also applies when $E(\tilde{Z}) \neq 0,$ except that the level of income must be adjusted from $Y$ to $Y+E(\tilde{Z})$ to take into account the nonzero expected return:
$$
\Pi(\tilde{Z}) \approx \frac{1}{2} \sigma_{\tilde{Z}}^{2} R_{A}(Y+E(\tilde{Z}))
$$
当保险仅仅补偿不确定性至$E(\tilde{Z})$时，
$$
u(Y+E\tilde{Z}-Fee) \longleftrightarrow u\left(Y+E\tilde{Z}- \Pi(\tilde{Z})\right)
$$

### 3.2 Stochastic Dominance

SBSD implies FSD implies SSD

#### First-order stochastic dominance

First-order stochastic dominance(FSD) Let $F_{A}(\tilde{x})$ and $F_{B}(\tilde{x})$ be two cumulative probability distributions for random payoffs in $[a, b] .$ We say that $F_{A}(\tilde{x}) F S D F_{B}(\tilde{x})$ if and only if:
$$
F_{A}(x) \leq F_{B}(x), \forall x
$$

that is, $F_{2}(x) \text{ FSD } F_{1}(x),$ if and only if
$$
E\left[u\left(Z_{2}\right)\right] \geq E\left[u\left(Z_{1}\right)\right]
$$
**for any nondecreasing Bernoulli utility function** $u$

state-by-state dominance implies first-order stochastic dominance but first-order stochastic dominance does not necessarily imply state-by-state dominance. 

But **first-order stochastic dominance remains quite a strong condition**. Since an asset that displays first-order stochastic dominance over all others will be preferred by any investor with vN-M utility who prefers higher payoffs to lower payoffs, the price of **such an asset is likely to be bid up until the dominance goes away**.

#### Second-order stochastic dominance

second-order stochastic dominance(SSD) Let $F_{A}(\tilde{x})$ and $F_{B}(\tilde{x})$ be two cumulative probability distributions for random payoffs in $[a, b] .$ We say that $F_{A}(\tilde{x}) \text{ SSD } F_{B}(\tilde{x})$ if and only if for any $x:$
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{x}\left[F_{B}(t)-F_{A}(t)\right] d t \geq 0
$$
(with strict inequality for some meaningful interval of values of $t$ ).

that is, asset 4 displays second-order stochastic dominance over asset $3,$ if and only if
$$
E\left[u\left(Z_{4}\right)\right] \geq E\left[u\left(Z_{3}\right)\right]
$$
for any nondecreasing and concave Bernoulli utility function $u$

Second-order stochastic dominance is a weaker condition than first-order stochastic dominance, in that first-order stochastic dominance implies second-order stochastic dominance but second-order stochastic dominance does not necessarily imply first-order stochastic dominance. 

But second-order stochastic dominance remains a strong condition. Since an asset that displays **second-order stochastic dominance over all others will be preferred by any risk-averse investor with vN-M utility, the price of such an asset is likely to be bid up until the dominance goes away.**

### 3.3 Mean Preserving Spreads

It is also useful, therefore, to consider an alternative criterion that focuses entirely on the standard deviation of a random payoff, as a measure of the riskiness of the corresponding asset, holding the mean or expected value fixed.

Graphically, a mean preserving spread takes probability from the center of a distribution and shifts it to the tails.

![](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/20447423-77796ce234acbc53.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)

Mathematically, one way of producing a mean preserving spread is to take one random variable $X_{1}$ and defining a second, $X_{2}$, by adding "noise" in the form of a third, zero-mean random variable $Z$ :
$$
X_{2}=X_{1}+Z
$$
with $E(Z)=0$

Let $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$, with $E\left(X_{1}\right)=E\left(X_{2}\right),$ be random payoffs on two assets. Then the following two statements are equivalent:

(i) $X_{2}=X_{1}+Z$ for some random variable $Z$ with $E(Z)=0$

(ii) asset 1 displays second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) over asset 2
