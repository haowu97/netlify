### Criteria for Choice Over Risky Prospects

“**risk**” refers to uncertainty about the future cash flows provided by a financial asset.

**state-by-state dominance** over investments 1 and 2, because it **pays as much in all states and strictly more in at least one state**. Any investor who prefers more to less (nonsatiated in consumption) would always choose investment 3 above the others.

**mean-variance dominance** over investment 2, since it offers a higher expected return with lower variance.

**Mean-variance dominance neither implies nor is implied by state-by-state dominance.**

In probability theory, if a random variable X can take on n possible values, X1; X2; ... ; Xn, with probabilities p1; p2; ...; pn, then the expected value of X is $ E(X) = p1X1 + p2X2 + ... + pnXn $ the variance of X is $ σ 2 (X) = p1[X1 − E(X)]2 + p2[X2 − E(X)]2 + ... + pn[Xn − E(X)]2 $ and the standard deviation of X is $ σ(X) = [σ 2 (X)](1/2) $ .

In a mean-variance (M-V) framework, an investor's wants to maximize a function $u\left(\mu_{r}, \sigma_{P}\right)$
She likes expected return $\left(\mu_{r}\right)$ and dislikes standard deviation $\left(\sigma_{P}\right)$ Recall that portfolio $A$ is said to exhibit mean-variance dominance over portfolio B if either

$$
\frac{\mu_{A}>\mu_{B}}{\mu_{A} \geq \mu_{B}} \text { and } \sigma_{A} \leq \sigma_{B}
$$

Mean-variance dominance neither implies nor is implied by state-by-state dominance.

Mean-variance Dominance can be expressed in the form of a criterion for selecting investments of equal magnitude For investments of the same Er, choose the one with lower σ For investments of the same σ, choose the one with greatest Er

William Sharpe (US, b.1934, Nobel Prize 1990) suggested that in these circumstances, it can help to compare the two assets’ **Sharpe ratios**, defined as E(r)/σ(r).

But **using the Sharpe ratio to choose between assets means assuming that investors “weight” the mean and standard deviation equally, in the sense that a doubling of σ(r) is adequately compensated by a doubling of E(r). Investors who are more or less averse to risk will disagree.**

#### Summary

State-by-state dominance is the most robust criterion, but often cannot be applied. 

Mean-variance dominance is more widely-applicable, but can sometimes be misleading and cannot always be applied. 

The Sharpe ratio can always be applied, but requires a very specific assumption about consumer attitudes towards risk. 

We need a more careful and comprehensive approach to comparing random cash flows.

###  Preferences and Utility Functions

rational: A1完备性、A2传递性

A.3. The preference relation is assumed to be **continuous**: if an and bn are two sequences of bundles such that an → a, bn → b and an  bn for all n, then a  b.Very small changes in consumption bundles cannot lead to large changes in preferences over those bundles.

An **ordinal utility function** describing a consumer’s preferences over two goods can be written as u(x, y), the same preferences could be expressed as another utility function that is an increasing transformation of u: g(x, y) = f (u(x, y)). Utility functions g and u give rise to identical indifference curve mappings. 

A **cardinal utility function** that preserves preference orderings **uniquely up to positive affine transformations**. Two utility indices are related by an affine transformation, i.e. u and v satisfies a relationship of the form v(x) = au(x) + b, where a and b are constants.

By Theorem 3.1, we already know that (C:2) and (C:3) are sufficient to guarantee the existence of a utility function U over lotteries and, by (C:1a), defined both on lotteries and specific payoffs received with certainty as well.

The concept of a Bernoulli utility function is ordinal  （单调变换保序）

the concept of vN-M utility function is cardinal!In this sense, the vN-M utility function that represents any given preference relation is not unique.（线性变换保序）

### The Paradox of the Independence Hypothesis：Allais parodox

The Allais paradox suggests that **feelings about probabilities may not always be “linear**,” but linearity in the probabilities is precisely what defines vN-M utility functions.
