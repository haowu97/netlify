## 1.1 Inter-temporal Optimization

Static optimization is to optimally allocate spending across different goods at a point of time (e.g. maximize utility from consuming apples and bananas today subject to current budget constraint).

**Intertemporal optimization** is to optimally allocate spending over time (e.g. maximize utility from consuming apples today and next year subject to intertemporal budget constraint).

### 1.1.1 Time Dimension

#### Intertemporal utility function

For simplicity, economists typically assume **separable, discounting and concave utility function** in 2 periods
$$
u\left(C_{0}\right)+\beta u\left(C_{1}\right)
$$

where $C_{0}$ and $C_{1}$ are consumptions today and next year

- A concave utility implies convex indifference curves with slope called intertemporal marginal rate of substitution (how much to give up today for next year)
- $u$ is concave utility function which implies consumption smoothing preference.

- $\beta<1$ is the discount factor, a measure of patience

#### Intertemporal budget constraint

Suppose
$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_{0}&=\text { income today } \\
Y_{1}&=\text { income next year }\\
S&= \text{amount saved(or borrowed if negative) today}\\
r&= \text{interest rate}
\end{aligned}
$$

Today $Y_{0} \geq C_{0}+S$.

Next year, $Y_{1}+(1+r) S \geq C_{1}$.

Thus the life-time budget constraint is
$$
Y_{0}+\frac{Y_{1}}{1+r} \geq C_{0}+\frac{C_{1}}{1+r}
$$

The present value of income must be sufficient to cover the presen value of consumption over the two periods!

The price of consumption today relative to the price of consumption next year is given by

$$
\frac{p_{0}}{p_{1}}=1+r
$$

The slope of the intertemporal budget constraint is $-(1+r)$.

#### Optimal Allocation

At the optimum, the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution equals the slope of the budget constraint
$$
\frac{u'(C_0)}{\beta u'(C_1)}=1+r
$$

### 1.1.2 Risk Dimension 

To add/model the element of risk, let's follow Arrow-Debreu by imagining that there are two possible outcomes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_{0} &=\text { income today } \\
Y_{1}^{G} &=\text { income next year under good state }
\end{aligned}
$$

$Y_{1}^{B}=$ income next year under bad state
where assumption $Y_{1}^{G}>Y_{1}^{B}$ makes good state good and $\pi=$ probability of the good state $1-\pi=$ probability of the bad state

How to represent preferences over risky alternatives?

Under uncertainty, the consumer maximizes expected utility $u\left(C_{0}\right)+\beta u\left(C_{1}\right)$ which equivalent to

$$
u\left(C_{0}\right)+\beta\left[\pi u\left(C_{1}^{G}\right)+(1-\pi) u\left(C_{1}^{B}\right)\right]
$$

We can see that concavity of the function u, which in the standard micro case represents a preference for diversity, represents a preference for smoothness in consumption over time and across states in the future–the consumer is risk averse in the sense that he does not want consumption in the bad state to be too much different from consumption in the good state.
$$
Y_0 + \underbrace{q_G Y^G_1 + q_B Y^B_1}_{\text{PV of future income}} ≥ C_0 + \underbrace{q_G C^G_1 + q_B C^B_1}_{\text{PV of future consumption}}
$$

Value a bond that pays its \$100 coupon at the end of each year for 3-years, and its par value of \$1,000 in 3-years You have discovered three pure discount bonds (each with a \$1,000 par value) that mature in 1, 2, and 3 years, and that are trading at \$960, \$890, and \$810 respectively
