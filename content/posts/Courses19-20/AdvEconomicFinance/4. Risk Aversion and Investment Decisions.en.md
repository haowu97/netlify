## 4.1 Portfolio Allocation

Risk averse investor decision making: risky vs. risk-free assets

$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_{0}&= \text{initial wealth} \\
a&= \text{amount allocated to stocks} \\
\tilde{r}&= \text{random return on stocks}\\
r_{f} &=\text {risk - free return} \\
\tilde{Y}_{1} &=\text { final wealth} \\
\tilde{Y}_{1} &=\left(1+r_{f}\right)\left(Y_{0}-a\right)+a(1+\tilde{r}) \\
&=Y_{0}\left(1+r_{f}\right)+a\left(\tilde{r}-r_{f}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Objective Function
The investor chooses a to maximize expected utility:

$$
\max _{a} E\left[u\left(\tilde{Y}_{1}\right)\right]=\max _{a} E u\left[Y_{0}\left(1+r_{f}\right)+a\left(\tilde{r}-r_{f}\right)\right]
$$

The first-order condition(F.O.C.) is

$$
E\left[u^{\prime}\left[Y_{0}\left(1+r_{f}\right)+a^{*}\left(\tilde{r}-r_{f}\right)\right]\left(\tilde{r}-r_{f}\right)\right]=0
$$

Note: we are allowing the investor to sell stocks short $\left(a^{*}<0\right)$ or to buy stocks on margin $\left(a^{*}>Y_{0}\right)$ if he or she desires.

**Theorem 5.1** If the Bernoulli utility function $u$ is increasing and concave, then

- $ a^{*}>0$ if and only if $E(\tilde{r})>r_{f}$
- $ a^{*}=0$ if and only if $E(\tilde{r})=r_{f}$
- $ a^{*}<0$ if and only if $E(\tilde{r})<r_{f}$

Thus, a risk-averse investor will always allocate at least some funds to the stock market if the expected return on stocks exceeds the risk-free rate.

定理证明

To prove the theorem, let
$$
W(a)=E\left[u^{\prime}\left[Y_{0}\left(1+r_{f}\right)+a\left(\tilde{r}-r_{f}\right)\right]\left(\tilde{r}-r_{f}\right)\right]
$$
so that the investor's first-order condition can be written more compactly as
$$
W\left(a^{*}\right)=0
$$
it follows that
$$
W^{\prime}(a)=E\left[u^{\prime \prime}\left[Y_{0}\left(1+r_{f}\right)+a\left(\tilde{r}-r_{f}\right)\right]\left(\tilde{r}-r_{f}\right)^{2}\right]<0
$$
since $u$ is concave. This means that $W$ is a decreasing function of
Finally, with
$$
\begin{aligned}
W(a) &=E\left[u^{\prime}\left[Y_{0}\left(1+r_{f}\right)+a\left(\tilde{r}-r_{f}\right)\right]\left(\tilde{r}-r_{f}\right)\right] \\
W(0) &=E\left[u^{\prime}\left[Y_{0}\left(1+r_{f}\right)\right]\left(\tilde{r}-r_{f}\right)\right] \\
&=u^{\prime}\left[Y_{0}\left(1+r_{f}\right)\right] E\left(\tilde{r}-r_{f}\right) \\
&=u^{\prime}\left[Y_{0}\left(1+r_{f}\right)\right]\left[E(\tilde{r})-r_{f}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$
since $u$ is increasing, this means that $W(0)$ has the same sign as
$$
E(\tilde{r})-r_{f}
$$
We now know that:

- $\bullet W(a)$ is a decreasing function
- $ W(0)$ has the same sign as $E(\tilde{r})-r_{f}$
- $ W\left(a^{*}\right)=0$

Proof
$=(\tilde{r})-r_{f}>0$ implies $W(0)>0,$ and since $W$ is decreasing, $\mathcal{W}\left(a^{*}\right)=0$ implies $a^{*}>0 .$ since $W(0)$ has the same sign as
$E(\tilde{r})-r_{f}, E(\tilde{r})-r_{f}>0$

风险中性情况

Before moving on, return to the general problem
$$
\max _{a} E u\left[Y_{0}\left(1+r_{f}\right)+a\left(\tilde{r}-r_{f}\right)\right]
$$
but assume now that the investor is risk-neutral, with
$$
u(Y)=\alpha Y+\beta
$$
and $\alpha>0,$ so that more wealth is preferred to less. The risk-neutral investor solves
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \max _{a} \in \alpha\left[Y_{0}\left(1+r_{f}\right)+a\left(\tilde{r}-r_{f}\right)\right]+\beta \\
=& \max _{a} \alpha Y_{0}\left(1+r_{f}\right)+a\left[E(\tilde{r})-r_{f}\right]+\beta
\end{aligned}
$$
So long as $E(\tilde{r})-r_{f}>0,$ the risk-neutral investor will choose $a^{*}$ to be as large as possible, borrowing as much as he or she is allowed to in order to buy more stocks on margin.

## 4.2 Risk Aversion and Portfolio Allocation

The following result was proven by Kenneth Arrow in "The Theory of Risk Aversion," published in the 1971 volume Essays in the Theory of Risk-Bearing and reprinted in 1983 in volume 3 of the Collected Papers of Kenneth $J$. Arrow (Harvard University Press). 

### 投资者之间比较

**Theorem 5.2*** Consider two investors, $i=1$ and $i=2,$ and suppose that for all wealth levels $Y$, $$ \begin{array}{l}R_{A}^{1}(Y)>R_{A}^{2}(Y) \\ \text { where } R_{A}^{i}(Y) \text { is investor i's coefficient of absolute risk aversion. Then } \\ a_{1}^{*}(Y)<a_{2}^{*}(Y)\end{array} $$ where $a_{i}^{*}(Y)$ is amount allocated by investor i to stocks when he or she has initial wealth $Y$.

ARA与投资额

**Theorem 5.4** Let $a^{*}\left(Y_{0}\right)$ be the solution to
$$
\max _{a} E u\left[Y_{0}\left(1+r_{f}\right)+a\left(\tilde{r}-r_{f}\right)\right]
$$
If $u(Y)$ is such that

1. $R_{A}^{\prime}(Y)<0$ then $\frac{d a^{*}\left(Y_{0}\right)}{d Y_{0}}>0$
2. $R_{A}^{\prime}(Y)=0$ then $\frac{d a^{*}\left(Y_{0}\right)}{d Y_{0}}=0$
3. $R_{A}^{\prime}(Y)>0$ then $\frac{d a^{*}\left(Y_{0}\right)}{d Y_{0}}<0$

RRA与投资弹性

Define the elasticity of the function $a^{*}\left(Y_{0}\right)$ as
$$
\eta=\frac{d\left(\ln a^{*}\left(Y_{0}\right)\right)}{d\left(\ln Y_{0}\right)}=\frac{Y_{0}}{a^{*}\left(Y_{0}\right)} \frac{d\left(a^{*}\left(Y_{0}\right)\right)}{d Y_{0}}
$$
The elasticity measures the percentage change in $a^{*}\left(Y_{0}\right)$ brought about by a percentage-point change in $Y_{0}$

**Theorem 5.5** Let $a^{*}\left(Y_{0}\right)$ be the solution to
$$
\max _{a} E u\left[Y_{0}\left(1+r_{f}\right)+a\left(\tilde{r}-r_{f}\right)\right]
$$
If $u(Y)$ is such that
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\text { (a) } R_{R}^{\prime}(Y)<0 \text { then } \eta>1 \\
\text { (b) } R_{R}^{\prime}(Y)=0 \text { then } \eta=1 \\
\text { (c) } R_{R}^{\prime}(Y)>0 \text { then } \eta<1
\end{array}
$$
Note that with constant relative risk aversion, $a^∗$ rises proportionally with wealth. Two additional

The theorem confirms what we know about CRRA utility: it implies that $a^{*}$ rises proportionally with $Y_{0}$. But the theorem extends the results to the cases of decreasing and increasing relative risk aversion.

$$
\frac{a^{*}}{Y_{0}}=K
$$
where
$$
K=\frac{\left(1+r_{f}\right)\left(\left[\pi\left(r_{G}-r_{f}\right)\right]^{1 / \gamma}-\left[(1-\pi)\left(r_{f}-r_{B}\right)\right]^{1 / \gamma}\right)}{\left(r_{G}-r_{f}\right)\left[(1-\pi)\left(r_{f}-r_{B}\right)\right]^{1 / \gamma}-\left(r_{B}-r_{f}\right)\left[\pi\left(r_{G}-r_{f}\right)\right]^{1 / \gamma}}
$$
Hence
$$
\begin{aligned}
\ln \left(a^{*}\left(Y_{0}\right)\right) &=\ln (K)+\ln \left(Y_{0}\right) \\
\eta &=\frac{d\left(\ln a^{*}\left(Y_{0}\right)\right)}{d\left(\ln Y_{0}\right)}=1
\end{aligned}
$$

## 4.3 Risk Aversion and Saving Behavior

Suppose there are two periods, $t=0$ and $t=1,$ and let
$Y_{0}=$ initial wealth 

$s=$ amount saved in period $\mathrm{t}=0$

$c_{0}=Y_{0}-s=$ amount consumed in period $t=0$ $\tilde{R}=1+\tilde{r}=$ random, gross return on savings $\bar{c}_{1}=s \tilde{R}=$ amount consumed in period $\mathrm{t}=1$
Suppose also that the investor has vN-M expected utility over consumption during periods $t=0$ and $t=1$ given by
$$
u\left(c_{0}\right)+\beta E\left[u\left(\tilde{c}_{1}\right)\right]=u\left(Y_{0}-s\right)+\beta E[u(s \tilde{R})]
$$
where the discount factor $\beta$ is a measure of patience

当储蓄收入$\tilde{R}$的不确定性上升时：

in the form of a mean preserving spread in the distribution of R˜ . Intuitively, one might expect there to be two offsetting effects: 

替代效应 the riskier return will make saving less attractive and thereby reduce s ∗ ; 

预防性储蓄 The riskier return might lead to “precautionary saving” in order to cushion period t = 1 consumption against the possibility of a bad output and thereby increase s ∗ .

let
$$
g(\tilde{R}) = u^{\prime}\left(s^{*} \tilde{R}\right) \tilde{R}
$$
Jensen’s inequality will imply that after a mean preserving spread the distribution of $\tilde{R}$ in this expectation will fall if g is concave and rise if g is convex.

The product and chain rules for differentiation imply
$$
\begin{aligned}
g^{\prime}(\tilde{R}) &=u^{\prime \prime}\left(s^{*} \tilde{R}\right) s^{*} \tilde{R}+u^{\prime}\left(s^{*} \tilde{R}\right) \\
g^{\prime \prime}(\tilde{R}) &=u^{\prime \prime \prime}\left(s^{*} \tilde{R}\right)\left(s^{*}\right)^{2} \tilde{R}+u^{\prime \prime}\left(s^{*} \tilde{R}\right) s^{*}+u^{\prime \prime}\left(s^{*} \tilde{R}\right) s^{*} \\
&=u^{\prime \prime \prime}\left(s^{*} \tilde{R}\right)\left(s^{*}\right)^{2} \tilde{R}+2 u^{\prime \prime}\left(s^{*} \tilde{R}\right) s^{*}
\end{aligned}
$$
implies that $g^{\prime \prime}(\tilde{R})$ has the same sign as
$$
u^{\prime \prime \prime}\left(s^{*} \tilde{R}\right) s^{*} \tilde{R}+2 u^{\prime \prime}\left(s^{*} \tilde{R}\right)
$$
To understand precautionary saving behavior, the concept of prudence is defined by Miles Kimball, “Precautionary Saving in the Small and in the Large,” Econometrica Vol.58 (January 1990): pp.53-73.

Kimball defines the coefficient of absolute prudence as
$$
P_{A}(Y)=-\frac{u^{\prime \prime \prime}(Y)}{u^{\prime \prime}(Y)}
$$
and the coefficient of relative prudence as
$$
P_{R}(Y)=-\frac{Y u^{\prime \prime \prime}(Y)}{u^{\prime \prime}(Y)}
$$
thereby extending the analogous measures of absolute and relative risk aversion.
Risk Aversion and Saving Behavior
$g^{\prime \prime}(\tilde{R})$ has the same sign as
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\qquad u^{\prime \prime \prime}\left(s^{*} \tilde{R}\right) s^{*} \tilde{R}+2 u^{\prime \prime}\left(s^{*} \tilde{R}\right) \\
r^{\prime \prime \prime}(Y) Y+2 u^{\prime \prime}(Y)=u^{\prime \prime}(Y)\left[\frac{Y u^{\prime \prime \prime}(Y)}{u^{\prime \prime}(Y)}+2\right]=u^{\prime \prime}(Y)\left[2-P_{R}(Y)\right]
\end{array}
$$
$g^{\prime \prime}(\tilde{R})$ is positive if $2<P_{R}(Y)$
$g^{\prime \prime}(\tilde{R})$ is negative if $2>P_{R}(Y)$

Kimball defines the coefficient of absolute prudence as
$$
P_{A}(Y)=-\frac{u^{\prime \prime \prime}(Y)}{u^{\prime \prime}(Y)}
$$
and the coefficient of relative prudence as
$$
P_{R}(Y)=-\frac{Y u^{\prime \prime \prime}(Y)}{u^{\prime \prime}(Y)}
$$
thereby extending the analogous measures of absolute and relative risk aversion.
Risk Aversion and Saving Behavior
$g^{\prime \prime}(\tilde{R})$ has the same sign as
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\qquad u^{\prime \prime \prime}\left(s^{*} \tilde{R}\right) s^{*} \tilde{R}+2 u^{\prime \prime}\left(s^{*} \tilde{R}\right) \\
u^{\prime \prime \prime}(Y) Y+2 u^{\prime \prime}(Y)=u^{\prime \prime}(Y)\left[\frac{Y u^{\prime \prime \prime}(Y)}{u^{\prime \prime}(Y)}+2\right]=u^{\prime \prime}(Y)\left[2-P_{R}(Y)\right]
\end{array}
$$
$g^{\prime \prime}(\tilde{R})$ is positive if $2<P_{R}(Y)$
$g^{\prime \prime}(\tilde{R})$ is negative if $2>P_{R}(Y)$

Hence, if $2<P_{R}(Y),$ then $g^{\prime \prime}(\tilde{R})>0 .$ since $g$ is convex, a mean preserving spread in the distribution of $\tilde{R}$ increases the right hand side of the optimality condition
$$
u^{\prime}\left(Y_{0}-s^{*}\right)=\beta E\left[u^{\prime}\left(s^{*} \tilde{R}\right) \tilde{R}\right]
$$
and $s^{*}$ must increase to maintain the equality. The precautionary saving effect dominates if the coefficient of relative prudence exceeds 2. 

**Kimball proves that more prudence induces more precautionary savings.**

### Prudence

While the paper is famous for its link with the behavior of precautionary savings, it can be equivalently interpreted in a different way. since marginal utility (and not total utility) is the relevant concept for the analysis of decisions, it might be interesting to characterize the cost of risk through its impact on marginal (and not total) utility. Instead of computing a risk premium that keeps total utility constant, Kimball suggests the prudence premium ( $\psi$ ) that keeps marginal utility constant. Formally one has:
$$
u^{\prime}\left(x+E(\tilde{\varepsilon})-\psi^{\prime \prime}(x, \tilde{\varepsilon})\right)=E\left[u^{\prime}(x+\tilde{\varepsilon})\right]
$$
It is then easy to show that:
$$
\psi^{\prime \prime}(x, \tilde{\varepsilon}) \cong \frac{\sigma_{\bar{\ell}}^{2}}{2}\left(-\frac{u^{m}(x)}{u^{\prime \prime}(x)}\right)
$$
where $-\frac{u^{m}(x)}{u^{\prime \prime}(x)}$ is the index of absolute prudence.
